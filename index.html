It covers 500 years of painting, following changes in fashion and technique, tracing links with wider European taste and connecting with other decorative arts.</p><p></p><h2>Billy Graham, God&#39;s Ambassador: A Celebration of His Life and Ministry</h2><p><p>For over sixty years, Billy Graham has traveled the world preaching the Gospel face-to-face to more than one hundred million people. Across the globe in Europe, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and Africa, his crusades have broken stadium attendance records. And with the advent of radio, television, and satellite broadcasts, Graham has reached more than two billion people in his lifetime. </p><p><em>Billy Graham: God's Ambassador</em> includes hundreds of photos from the archives of Graham's photographer, Russ Busby, along with quotes, comments, and personal reflections from the past half century, most of them in the words of Graham himself and those who have been the closest to him. Unlike any other book ever published on his life and ministry, this insightful edition captures Graham the advocate, preaching for human rights and world peace; Graham the counselor, with presidents and world leaders; Graham the inspirer, a positive influence in times of conflict and discord; and Graham the husband and father, at home with his family. </p><p>This unique, once-in-a-lifetime volume beautifully captures the public and private moments of one of the world's most prominent figures, and certainly the most influential Christian of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Reading God&#39;s Ambassador is like browsing through Billy Graham&#39;s personal scrapbook. It is a collection of powerful pictures depicting Billy&#39;s life and ministry accented with newspaper clippings and quotes from Billy and Ruth and their family, friends, and admirers. This pictorial history of an astonishing and fervently faithful man is accompanied by his story in words-from his birth in rural North Carolina, to his decision to commit his life to Christ at age seventeen, to the beginning of his unprecedented ministry that has touched millions of people on every continent, to his private family life and his relationships with each president from Harry Truman to George W. Bush-the reader is left with the feeling that they now know the Reverend Billy Graham. The photos are from the official archive of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and most were shot by Graham&#39;s long-time chief photographer Russ Busby. This is an updated and more managebly sized edition of a popular Time-Life coffee-table book that has gone out of print.<p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association takes the message of God's love to the world through crusades, conferences, television, radio, film, publishing, the Internet, and other international ministries.

Blood and other matter draining from the terrible head wound soaked the threadbare carpet. His thin, wiry body was crumpled at the foot of the grand staircase that once upon a time had graced the lobby of Aurora Point Hotel.</p><p>He looked up at Madeline with faded blue eyes glazed with shock and blood loss.</p><p>&#x201c;Maddie? Is that you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Tom. You&#x2019;ve had a bad fall. Lie still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I failed, Maddie. I&#x2019;m sorry. Edith trusted me to protect you. I failed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Tom.&#x201d; Madeline held her wadded-up scarf against the terrible gash on Tom&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling nine-one-one. Help will be here soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too late.&#x201d; Tom struggled to reach out to her with a clawlike hand that had been weathered and scarred from decades of hard physical labor. &#x201c;Too late.&#x201d;</p><p>The 911 operator was asking for information.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . the nature of your emergency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the Aurora Point Hotel,&#x201d; Madeline said, automatically sliding into her executive take-charge tone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Tom Lomax, the caretaker. He&#x2019;s had a bad fall. He needs an ambulance immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a vehicle on the way,&#x201d; the operator said. &#x201c;Is he bleeding?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try to stop the bleeding by applying pressure.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline looked at the blood-soaked scarf she was using to try to stanch the flood pouring from the wound.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think I&#x2019;m doing?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Get someone here. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>She tossed the phone down on the floor so that she could apply more pressure to Tom&#x2019;s injury. But she could feel his life force seeping away. His eyes were almost blank.</p><p>&#x201c;The briefcase,&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>Another shock wave crashed through her.</p><p>&#x201c;Tom, what about the briefcase?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I failed.&#x201d; Tom closed his eyes. &#x201c;Sunrise. You always liked my sunrises.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tom, please, tell me about the briefcase.&#x201d;</p><p>But Tom was beyond speech now. He took one more raspy breath and then everything about him stopped. The utter stillness of death settled on him.</p><p>Madeline realized that the blood was no longer pouring from the wound. She touched bloody fingertips to Tom&#x2019;s throat. There was no pulse.</p><p>A terrible silence flooded the lost-in-time lobby of the abandoned hotel. She knew that Tom was gone, but she had read that the first responder was supposed to apply chest compressions until the medics arrived. She positioned her hands over his heart.</p><p>Somewhere in the echoing gloom a floorboard creaked. She froze, her gaze fixed on the broken length of balcony railing that lay on the threadbare carpet beside the body. For the first time she noticed the blood and bits of hair clinging to it.</p><p>There were probably several scenarios that could explain the blood and hair on the broken railing, but the one that made the most sense was that it had been used to murder Tom.</p><p>The floorboards moaned again. As with the blood and hair on the strip of balcony railing, there were a lot of possible explanations for the creaking sounds overhead. But one of them was that Tom had, indeed, been murdered and the killer was still on the scene.</p><p>She listened intently, hoping to hear sirens, but the wind was picking up now, cloaking sounds in the distance.</p><p>The floorboards overhead groaned again. This time she was almost certain she heard a footstep. Her intuition was screaming at her now.</p><p>Instinctively she turned off the phone so that it would not give away her location if the operator called back. She scrambled to her feet.</p><p>Somewhere on the floor above, rusty door hinges squeaked. One of the doors that allowed access to the upstairs veranda had just opened.</p><p>She looked down at Tom one last time and knew in her heart that there was nothing more she could do for him.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Tom,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>Her car was parked in the wide, circular driveway in front. She slung the strap of her heavy tote over one shoulder and sprinted toward the lobby doors.</p><p>The vast, ornate room was drenched in age and gloom. The dusty chandeliers were suspended from the high ceiling like so many dark, frozen waterfalls. The electricity had been cut off eighteen years earlier. When her grandmother had closed the old hotel she had left all the furnishings behind.</p><p>Edith had claimed that the heavy, oversized chairs and end tables, the graceful, claw-footed sofas, and the velvet draperies had been custom designed to suit the Victorian-style architecture and would look out of place anywhere else. But Madeline knew that was not the real reason why they hadn&#x2019;t taken any of the furniture with them. The real reason was that neither of them wanted any reminders of the Aurora Point Hotel.</p><p>In its heyday at the dawn of the twentieth century, the hotel had been a glamorous destination, attracting the wealthy travelers and vacationers of the era. Her grandmother had tried to revive the ambience and atmosphere of that earlier time, but in the end it had proved too expensive. In the wake of the violent night eighteen years ago, there had been no way to get rid of the property. Selling the Aurora Point Hotel was never an option after that night. There were too many secrets buried on the grounds.</p><p>Madeline was halfway across the cavernous space when she saw the shadows shift beneath the rotting velvet curtains that covered one of the bay windows. It could have been a trick of the light caused by the oncoming storm, but she was not about to take a chance. The shadow had looked too much like a partial silhouette of a figure moving very rapidly toward the front doors. It was possible that she had seen the shadow of the killer. The bastard had used the veranda stairs at the back of the building to get down to the ground and was now moving toward the front lobby entrance to intercept her.</p><p>In another moment whoever was out there would come through the lobby doors. She had to assume the worst-case scenario&#x2014;Tom&#x2019;s killer was hunting her.</p><p>Madeline retrieved her keys from her shoulder bag and dropped the tote on the floor. She could hear the muffled thud of running footsteps on the lower veranda now.</p><p>She bolted behind the broad staircase and went down a narrow service hall. She had grown up in the Aurora Point. She knew every inch of the place. In the many decades of its existence it had been remodeled and repaired countless times. The gracious, oversized proportions of the public rooms concealed a warren of smaller spaces that made up the back-of-the-house. There was a large kitchen, a commercial-sized pantry, storage rooms, and the laundry.</p><p>There was also the back stairs that the staff had used to service the guest rooms.</p><p>She summoned up a mental diagram of the layout of the sprawling hotel grounds. It was clear that there was no way to get to her car without being seen by whoever was on the veranda.</p><p>She heard the lobby door open just as she emerged from the small, dark hallway into the pantry. The silence that followed iced her nerves. Most people who happened to walk in on a dead body would have made some noise. At the very least they would be calling 911.</p><p>So much for the fleeting hope that the intruder might be an innocent transient or a high school kid who had stumbled onto the murder scene and was as scared as she was.</p><p>She heard more footsteps&#x2014;long, deliberate strides. Someone was searching the first floor, looking for her. It would be only a matter of time before she was discovered. If the person stalking her was armed, she would not stand a chance of making it to her car.</p><p>She tried to think through a workable strategy. On the positive side, help was on the way. She needed the equivalent of a safe room until the authorities arrived.</p><p>She went to the doorway of the pantry and looked out into the big kitchen. The old appliances loomed like dinosaurs in the shadows. Beyond lay the service stairs that led to the guest rooms on the upper floors.</p><p>She rushed across the kitchen, not even trying to conceal her movements. Her shoes rang on the old tile floor. She knew her pursuer must have heard her.</p><p>Muffled footsteps suddenly pounded across the lobby, heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Madeline opened the door of the service staircase and raced up to the next floor, praying that none of the steps gave way beneath her weight.</p><p>She reached the first landing, turned, and went down the hall. Most of the room doors were closed. She chose one at the far end of the corridor, opened it, and rushed inside.</p><p>Whirling, she slammed the door shut and slid the ancient bolt home. A determined man could kick the door down, but it would take some work.</p><p>She could hear the intruder coming up the service stairs. But her pursuer would have to check the rooms one by one to find her.</p><p>Heart pounding, her breath tight in her chest, she looked down and was vaguely surprised to see that she was still clutching her phone. She stared at it, oddly numb. Very carefully she switched it on and tapped in the emergency number again. She set the phone on the top of a dusty dresser.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hang up again,&#x201d; the operator said earnestly. &#x201c;The ambulance and police should be there any minute. Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Madeline said.</p><p>She went to the nearest piece of stout furniture, a heavy armchair, and started to drag it across the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you in danger?&#x201d; the operator demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Madeline said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m upstairs in one of the bedrooms. Someone is coming down the hall. He&#x2019;ll be here any second. I&#x2019;ve locked the door but I don&#x2019;t know how long that will stop him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Push something in front of the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great idea,&#x201d; Madeline gasped. She shoved harder on the heavy chair. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t I think of it?&#x201d;</p><p>The big chair seemed to weigh a ton, but it was moving now. She managed to maneuver it in front of the door.</p><p>She heard the footsteps stop outside her room. She grabbed her phone and headed toward the French doors that opened onto the veranda.</p><p>The storm struck just as she stepped outside. Wind-driven rain lashed at her. But she could hear the sirens in the distance.</p><p>She knew the intruder had heard them too because the footsteps were retreating down the hall, heading toward the rear stairs at a run. She knew the killer was headed for the safety of the woods that bordered the rear of the property. She remembered the old service road that wound through the trees.</p><p>A short time later she heard a car engine roar to life. The intruder was gone.</p><p>She reminded herself that there were not a lot of ways off Cooper Island. A private ferry provided service twice a day. There were also floatplanes and charter boats. The local police might have a shot at catching the killer.</p><p>Or not. Most of Cooper Island was undeveloped. A great deal of it was covered in forest. There were plenty of places where a determined murderer could hide until he found a way off the island.</p><p>She rushed to meet the emergency vehicles pulling into the drive. Mentally she made a list of what she could&#x2014;and could not&#x2014;tell the cops.</p><p>She had spent eighteen years keeping secrets. She was good at it.</p></p><h2>Apology for Origen: with On the Falsification of the Books of Origen by Rufinus (Fathers of the Church Patristic Series)</h2><p><p>Presented here for the first time in English translation (from Rufinus's Latin version) is the <i>Apology for Origen</i>, the sole surviving work of St. Pamphilus of Caesarea (d. 310 AD), who was one of the most celebrated priest-martyrs of the ancient Church. Written from prison with the collaboration of Eusebius (later to become the bishop of Caesarea), the Apology attempts to refute accusations made against Origen, defending his views with passages quoted from his own works. Pamphilus aims to show Origen's fidelity to the apostolic proclamation, citing excerpts that demonstrate Origen's orthodoxy and his vehement repudiation of heresy. He then takes up a series of specific accusations raised against Origen's doctrine, quoting passages from Origen's writings that confute charges raised against his Christology. Some excerpts demonstrate that Origen did not deny the history of the biblical narratives; others clarify Origen's doctrine of souls and aspects of his eschatology. Pamphilus was beheaded on February 16, 310, under the emperor Maximinus Daia.</p><p>In 397 AD, at the urgent invitation of his friend Macarius, Rufinus of Aquileia translated Pamphilus's <i>Apology</i> into Latin, the first of his extensive translations of Origen's writings. Rufinus probably did not suspect the incomparable importance of his undertaking, but by translating Origen he saved from impending ruin some of the most precious monuments of Christian antiquity, destined to form Latin minds for many years to come.</p><p>Also presented in this volume is a new English translation of Rufinus's work, <i>On the Falsification of the Books of Origen</i> in which Rufinus sets forth arguments for his theory that Origen's writings had suffered interpolations by heretics. Rufinus demonstrates that literary frauds and forgeries carried out by heretics were widespread and affected many writers. He may have been misled by his intense respect for Origen's genius, and he certainly exaggerated when he claimed that all the doctrinal errors to be met with in Origen's works were due to interpolations.</p><br><p></p><br><p>ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR:</p><p>Thomas P.

W. F. Hegel (World Authors Series)</h2><p><p>Series Editors: Bernth Lindfors, University of Texas at Austin; Robert Lecker, McGill University; David OConnell, Georgia State University; David William Foster, Arizona State University; Janet Pérez, Texas Tech University.TWAYNES UNITED STATES AUTHORS, ENGLISH AUTHORS, and WORLD AUTHORS Series present concise critical introductions to great writers and their works. Devoted to critical interpretation and discussion of an authors work, each study takes account of major literary trends and important scholarly contributions and provides new critical insights with an original point of view. An Authors Series volume addresses readers ranging from advanced high school students to university professors. The book suggests to the informed reader new ways of considering a writers work. A reader new to the work under examination will, after reading the Authors Series, be compelled to turn to the originals, bringing to the reading a basic knowledge and fresh critical perspectives.</p></p><p>Among philosophical systems, Hegel&#39;s is unique in its dialectical-speculative approach, its non-foundational circularity, and its coordination with the history of philosophy. In this study, Howard P. Kainz emphasizes this uniqueness by focusing on Hegel&#39;s methodology, terminology, metaphorical and paradoxical language, interpretation of the history of philosophy, and special contributions to metaphysics, the philosophy of nature, philosophical anthropology, political philosophy, and other areas. Kainz forgoes customary paragraph-by-paragraph or section-by-section analysis in order to focus on Hegel&#39;s system as a whole and its seminal ideas, making generous use of representative texts. Kainz gives special attention to the interrelationship between dialectical methodology and paradoxical propositions; the prevalence of metaphor in the philosophy of nature; and the close interrelationship between Christian doctrine and Hegelian speculation. A rich assortment of diagrams and tables further elucidates Kainz&#39;s systematic and historical analyses.Kainz is Professor of Philosophy at Marquette University.</p><h2>The Kennedys Amidst the Gathering Storm: A Thousand Days in London, 1938-1940</h2><p><p>In <em>The Kennedys Amidst the Gathering Storm</em>, Will Swift presents a fresh, empathetic interpre�tation of the ambassadorship of Joseph Kennedy and explores the intricate, often shifting relation�ships among Kennedy, Chamberlain, Churchill, and, of course, Roosevelt. </p><p>Arriving in London in early 1938, the Irish-Catholic Kennedys were welcomed by politicians, aristocrats, and intellectuals, all eager to court America. They finally appeared to have overcome their lifelong status as outsiders. From 1938 to 1940, the Kennedys crystallized their identity as protagonists on the world stage, making public the competitive and clannish intrafamily dynamics that would fuel their mythic rise to power. They all learned from their father's successes&#x2014;and failures. The older children&#x2014;Joe Jr., Jack, and Kathleen&#x2014;took an active part in England's glittering, "last fling before the bombs fall" society, but all nine children charmed, their every move chronicled by the British and American media. John F. Kennedy's path to the White House began in London. As his father's political fortunes dimmed, Jack published a best-selling book and his star rose. </p><p>Drawing on recently released Kennedy family archives, Joseph P. Kennedy's private papers, and using rare photographs of English society and the photogenic Kennedy clan, Dr. Swift, with penetrating psychological insight, brings to life this fascinating family during a dramatic one thousand day period. </p></p><p><p>Will Swift, Ph.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist, who has been writing about American leaders and British royalty of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for more than twenty years. He is the author of <em>The Roosevelts and the Royals</em>, which Blanche Wiesen Cook called "a splendid addition to our understanding of the extraordinary Anglo-American partnership," and which Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., called "an excellent book." Will Swift lives in New York City and at the Nathan Wild House in Valatie, New York.</p>Clinical psychologist and historian Swift (<i>The Roosevelts and the Royals</i>) capably documents Joseph P. Kennedy's troubled tenure as American minister to the Court of St. James's, and the experiences of his family during these years, aiming to present a fair and comprehensive portrait of a man he says has been caricatured by other historians. But Kennedy's flaws still appear to outweigh his virtues. He proved a problem to FDR almost immediately, casting his lot with such British appeasers as Neville Chamberlain, Nancy Astor and others of the so-called Cliveden set. This earned him the enmity of Winston Churchill and criticism from such administration figures as Henry Morgenthau Jr., Cordell Hull and FDR himself, who had to regularly remind Kennedy that his role was to implement, not define, United States policy. Kennedy lasted just over two years, during which his second eldest son, Jack, became a bestselling author with <i>Why England Slept</i>. Eldest son Joe Jr. toured war-torn Spain and wrote articles in support of Franco's Fascist forces. And daughter Kathleen (Kick) became immersed in aristocratic British nightlife, meeting Billy Cavendish&#x2014;the marquess of Hartington and a Protestant&#x2014;to whom she would eventually be married, to her Catholic mother's horror. All this Swift narrates with grace and style. Illus. and photos. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Patanjali, the legendary sage and author of this 2,250-year-old work, was concerned not solely with physical development, or even mental development. In fact, the original purpose of yoga was&#x2015;and remains&#x2015;to function as a complete spiritual path where the body serves as a gateway to enlightenment.</p><p>On <i>The Yoga Matrix</i>, the renowned instructor Richard Freeman immerses us in the rich teachings and sutras that inform the many schools of yoga, and reveals how the body can serve as the ultimate laboratory, temple, and place of pilgrimage for spiritual inquiry. Looking back 5,000 years, Freeman uncovers the living roots of yoga philosophy, and observes how they have grown into many schools, techniques, and philosophies that are united by a vast, interpenetrating matrix that holds the key to understanding yoga's full depth and greater purpose.</p><p>Freeman first traveled to India in 1968, where he began a lifetime of study with the living masters of yoga and its mysteries. Now he teaches these authentic lessons and their original subtleties, with the questions and concerns of the serious Western student in mind. What is the yogic view of reality? Why was yoga first developed? How is progress traditionally measured? What are the principles of working with the body's subtle energy?

He seemed pointed toward stardom, but would it be in basketball, his true favorite, or maybe in track, where he qualified for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials as a hurdler? As for playing football, the only sport that really mattered in Griffin&#x2019;s small Texas town, first he had to overcome his mother&#x2019;s objections to the violence and danger&#x2014;which he did by making a &#x201c;Pinkie Promise&#x201d; with her that no one would catch him. Eventually, he began to realize that all of his remarkable talents&#x2014;unrivaled speed, pinpoint accuracy, exceptional intelligence, single-minded drive&#x2014;combined into a potent force that few quarterbacks could rival. What followed seemed almost destined: a football scholarship to Baylor University, three exceptional seasons capped by winning the Heisman Trophy, and the 2012 draft&#x2014;where Griffin, as the second overall pick, became the franchise quarterback for one of the oldest and most storied football teams in the country.<br><br>In <i>RG3: The Promise</i>, <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Dave Sheinin provides an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at Griffin&#x2019;s first year in the NFL, from his record-breaking first game to the frightening knee injury that ended the Redskins&#x2019; playoff hopes. An award-winning journalist himself, Sheinin has reported on Griffin&#x2019;s rookie season every step of the way, and now has written a unique, intimate look inside the transformation of one of the NFL&#x2019;s brightest young stars.</p><p>Dave Sheinin is an award-winning sports and features writer for The Washington Post, where he has worked since 1999.

This, late in the fourth quarter of his first NFL playoff game, was the last moment when the trajectory was still unquestionably pointed skyward, when nobody yet worried about the future or held him up as a cautionary tale, when all that mattered was this moment and this drive, when all anybody asked this twenty-two-year-old rookie quarterback to do was to move the ball 88 yards in 6 minutes 25 seconds, all that remained on the game-clock, for the tying score.</p><p>It was the last moment you still had faith that the man known as RG3, bum knee and all, could do it, all of it: put the ball in the end zone, win the game, redeem the Washington Redskins franchise, become the face of the NFL, maybe even change the world someday. Your faith may not have been what it was an hour earlier, when his limp was less noticeable, or a month earlier, when there was no limp at all. But the kid had this way of making people believe in him.</p><p>The ball was at the 12-yard line, on the right hash mark, atop the chopped-up turf at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland. It was just after seven o&#x2019;clock in the evening on January 6, 2013, with Griffin&#x2019;s Redskins trailing the visiting Seattle Seahawks by a touchdown in their NFC wild-card playoff game. It was second-and-22.</p><p>In those last few moments before the ball was snapped, as Griffin crouched four yards behind the center, held his hands in front of him, and barked out the signals, the mind could fathom no outcome that wasn&#x2019;t at the very least a satisfying one&#x2014;full of hope for the future and the singular type of awe that comes from witnessing the rise of a transcendent young athlete before our eyes. The Redskins would either come back to beat the Seahawks here and advance to the next stage of the playoffs, or they wouldn&#x2019;t. But even if they lost and saw their season come to an end, on this particular day&#x2014;as the Redskins played their first home playoff game in thirteen years&#x2014;the future seemed bigger than any one victory or loss. The Redskins had already done more this season than anyone could have reasonably expected. Largely because of Griffin&#x2019;s immense talents and the sheer force of his personality, they were relevant again, regardless of what happened here, and the coming years were all but certain to be full of epic victories, highlight-reel plays starring number 10, and, one suspected, February parades down Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>Win or lose here, Griffin had already done the heavy lifting in restoring the Redskins to prominence and establishing himself as the top rookie and arguably the most exciting player in the league. Less than a month later, he would be named the NFL&#x2019;s Offensive Rookie of the Year. With an off-the-field magnetism that matched his on-field brilliance&#x2014;his replica jersey that season sold more units than any other player&#x2019;s since they started keeping track of the numbers&#x2014;he was the future face of the NFL, adored by fans nationwide as well as by Madison Avenue.</p><p>Griffin&#x2019;s sprained knee had been getting worse throughout the game, his limp more pronounced, and here in the fourth quarter the crowd was getting nervous. Shouldn&#x2019;t the Redskins get him out of there? He had been wearing a brace over the knee since injuring it a month earlier, and the team had said he couldn&#x2019;t injure himself further by playing. The leading sports orthopedist in the nation was right there on the Redskins&#x2019; sideline, keeping watch on him. But this didn&#x2019;t look good. Every step seemed a struggle.</p><p>The snap was low and to Griffin&#x2019;s left. Perfect. When Griffin was a boy, his father used to put him through improvisation drills just like this: Now the ball is snapped over your head. Now it&#x2019;s way off to the side. The play-call is worthless now. Toss it out the window. You&#x2019;re going to have to make it up from here&#x2014;and with the ball on the ground, the defense smells blood. They&#x2019;re closing in. Quick, what are you going to do? You have to be prepared for that, son. It&#x2019;s going to happen. And sure enough, a couple of times during Griffin&#x2019;s stellar career at Baylor University, when the ball was snapped over his head, or when he simply dropped it, he calmly scooped it up, circled past the defenders, and delivered it to the end zone.</p><p>But here, with the ball suddenly at his feet, Griffin half-lunged and half-bent down for the ball, planting on his right foot, and something in his knee gave way.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>They locked their pinkies together, little Robby Griffin and his mother, Jacqueline, and he promised&#x2014;again, but this time a Pinkie Promise, which meant you absolutely could not break it&#x2014;that he wouldn&#x2019;t get hurt. That in fact no one was even fast enough to catch him, let alone hurt him.</p><p>There was every reason to believe the boy. There wasn&#x2019;t another twelve-year-old in all of Copperas Cove, Texas, who could run like him, and everyone knew it. He was already gaining a measure of renown as the best young athlete in that part of central Texas&#x2014;the best basketball player, the fastest hurdler. In those days, the boy worshipped Michael Jordan and wanted nothing more than to grow up to be the next MJ. But football was king in Texas, of course, and as his seventh-grade year approached at S. C. Lee Junior High School, the boy wanted to play the sport that everyone talked about.</p><p>Nobody knew him as &#x201c;the Third&#x201d; back then, as a twelve-year-old, even though he was the third in a line of Robert Griffins. He was either Rob or Robby or Little Rob, so as to distinguish the youngster from his father, who was simply Robert, or if you preferred, Big Robert or Big Rob or Mr. Griffin or Coach Griffin&#x2014;but never Robert Junior, and never, ever, ever just plain Junior. Big Robert, a huge football fan, was fine with the idea of his son playing the sport, but it was Jacqueline who needed convincing. In the end, Big Rob and Robby talked her into it, but only if her son Pinkie Promised her.</p><p>&#x201c;If you get tackled, then you&#x2019;ll quit football?&#x201d; she asked the boy, locking her pinkie around his.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Mom,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But they&#x2019;ll have to catch me to tackle me&#x2014;and they won&#x2019;t catch me.&#x201d;</p><p>And so began, for young Robert Griffin III and his family, a lifetime of grappling with the dangers of football&#x2014;of rationalization and internal deal-making, of precautions taken and precautions ignored, of hits avoided and hits absorbed, of maternal worry and paternal pride in the boy&#x2019;s growing toughness.</p><p>But actually, the reckoning had begun even earlier than that. When he was seven years old and living with relatives in New Orleans while his parents, both sergeants in the Army, were deployed in Korea, little Robby was on his way to get signed up for peewee football, in the passenger seat of a car being driven by his uncle Shane Griffin, when Uncle Shane suddenly turned the car around. What had made him change his mind? Deep down, he knew the boy wasn&#x2019;t cut out to play football with the rougher, harder &#x201c;project kids&#x201d; of the Iberville Projects where they lived. Robby was an outsider, a kid raised mostly on Army bases, and he was a little soft. If he played, there was a good chance he was going to get himself hurt, and Uncle Shane couldn&#x2019;t let that happen on his watch.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Shane Griffin recalled, &#x201c;we went and got some snowballs instead.&#x201d; (Snowballs, for the uninitiated, are frozen, fruity treats known in other parts of the country as snow cones or shaved ice.)</p><p>Fifteen years, two concussions, and one knee surgery later, as Robert Griffin III stood behind the center in the fourth quarter of his first NFL playoff game, with the Redskins&#x2019; season ticking away, he could have used a little luck, a little divine intervention, a little stronger knee brace, a little healthier playing field.</p><p>But maybe what he really needed was an Uncle Shane.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>You notice things when you cover one person for the better part of a year, as I did in 2012 covering Robert Griffin III for the <i>Washington Post.</i> You watch through binoculars, and you jot things down in a notebook or type them into a computer file&#x2014;seemingly unrelated, trivial things, stuff that&#x2019;s probably not even worth a line in a three-thousand-word story but that strikes you at the time as curious or telling or emblematic of something&#x2014;and when you look back on all these trivial things, you find that perhaps, taken together, they do mean something. There&#x2019;s a piece of a narrative there.</p><p>You notice Griffin, during one of the Redskins&#x2019; first pre&#x2013;training camp workouts in May&#x2014;the ones called &#x201c;organized team activities,&#x201d; or OTAs&#x2014;spitting on the artificial turf of the team&#x2019;s indoor practice facility as he jogs past. Then you notice him stopping in his tracks, doubling back, and sheepishly smushing the dollop of spit into the turf with his foot. It&#x2019;s as if he&#x2019;s hearing his mother&#x2019;s voice in his head saying, <i>You wouldn&#x2019;t do that in somebody&#x2019;s house, would you?</i></p><p>You notice the Gatorade cups strewn all over the Redskins&#x2019; sideline as players, in the heat of battle on a regular-season Sunday afternoon, grab a cup off a table filled with cups, throw back its contents, and toss the cup on the ground&#x2014;too busy, or too psyched-up, or too important to put the empty cup in the trash can that sits behind the bench. And then you see Griffin drinking from his cup, and you see him walking around the bench and dropping the cup in the trash can. The great ones are often meticulous like that, whether about their schedules, their lockers, or their appearance. But Griffin doesn&#x2019;t just seem meticulous. He seems overwhelmingly polite.</p><p>You notice how he pauses in the middle of his news conferences, in the shade of a tree outside the Redskins&#x2019; headquarters in Ashburn, Virginia&#x2014;almost directly below the flight path for runway 19L of Dulles International Airport&#x2014;whenever an approaching jet passes overhead so that the audio isn&#x2019;t ruined for the TV and radio stations. You note that nobody else around the Redskins does that.</p><p>You notice the way he stands in the huddle, leaning forward on one leg, with his other leg behind him, so that his face is near the center of the huddle but he is still at eye level with his teammates&#x2014;rather than crouching down, as some do, so that you have to look up at everyone, or leaning in sideways, halfheartedly, as if you&#x2019;ve got better things to do. The way Griffin does it, he can look into everyone&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>And you notice, on September 16, 2012&#x2014;in the waning minutes of the Redskins&#x2019; gut-wrenching 31&#x2013;28 loss to the St. Louis Rams in Week 2&#x2014;Griffin approaching a teammate sitting alone on the bench in misery. The player is Josh Morgan, a veteran wide receiver, and moments earlier he had single-handedly blown the Redskins&#x2019; final chance at a comeback by throwing the ball at an opponent out of frustration and drawing a fifteen-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, pushing them out of field goal range&#x2014;a lapse in judgment that would later make him the target of death threats and racist taunts. As those final seconds ticked down, no other Redskins player would go anywhere near Morgan on the bench until Griffin, who that day made his second regular-season NFL start and was about to absorb his first NFL loss, walked over, rubbed Morgan&#x2019;s head, leaned in, and said something to him. </p><p>&#x201c;Keep your head up and keep going,&#x201d; Griffin told him.</p><p>Morgan looked up, nodded, and went back to his thoughts&#x2014;but right there something had changed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, it did mean a lot to me,&#x201d; Morgan recalled later. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have to do that.&#x201d;</p><p>Clearly, Griffin was different. The question was, different how?</p><p>In his famous biography of Bill Bradley, <i>A Sense of Where You Are,</i> author John McPhee wrote of his subject, &#x201c;Basketball was more a part of him than he a part of basketball. The most interesting thing about Bill Bradley was not just that he was a great basketball player, but that he succeeded so amply in other things that he was doing at the same time, reached a more promising level of attainment, and, in the end, put basketball aside because he had something better to do.&#x201d;</p><p>It was easy to view Griffin in similar terms. Don&#x2019;t misunderstand&#x2014;Bradley was a unique figure in sports history: a Rhodes Scholar and Princeton man who enjoyed a Hall of Fame basketball career, then went on to become a three-term United States senator. But just as with Bradley and basketball, Griffin seemed like someone for whom football wasn&#x2019;t the destination, but merely the vehicle to get him to something bigger and more important. Whether he eventually went into politics or some other field, Griffin, like Bradley, seemed destined to rise above his sport.</p><p>There was only one difference: Bradley&#x2019;s sport didn&#x2019;t have the potential to maim him for life.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>When Jackie Griffin told me the Pinkie Promise story, we were sitting on the metal bleachers of the football field at S. C. Lee Junior High in Copperas Cove, where her son had first played organized football. It was April 16, 2012, a beautiful, cloudless Texas spring day, just ten days before her son would be chosen by the Redskins with the No. 2 overall selection of the NFL draft.</p><p>Petite and stylish, with a toothy smile that left no doubt as to where her son had gotten his, she could have passed for Robert Griffin III&#x2019;s sister, though she was already a grandmother (the Griffins&#x2019; oldest daughter, Jihan, had a four-year-old daughter, Jania). While her son gave an interview on the black asphalt track below, Jacqueline sat on the bleachers next to Robert&#x2019;s fianc�e, Rebecca Liddicoat, and watched him. She had never missed one of her son&#x2019;s games, at any level, and was already figuring on moving to whatever NFL city Robert wound up in, in order to keep that streak alive.</p><p>In those days, the NFL seemed to be at something of a crossroads. Less than a month earlier, the league had suspended three New Orleans Saints coaches, plus the team&#x2019;s general manager, for their roles in what had come to be known as &#x201c;Bountygate&#x201d;&#x2014;the alleged payment system whereby defensive players were rewarded with cash bonuses for hits that injured opposing players. A few weeks later, suspensions would also be announced for four players allegedly involved in the bounties. This came, of course, on top of the ongoing concussion scandal that was proceeding along incrementally&#x2014;another lawsuit filed here, another ex-player revealed to have brain damage there.</p><p>This was the NFL into which Robert and Jacqueline Griffin were about to entrust the youngest of their three children, and I wondered if Mrs. Griffin had any reservations about seeing her son play such a violent sport at the highest, fastest, biggest level, given all that had emerged in recent months. That&#x2019;s when she told the story of the Pinkie Promise. It was a cute story, and she chuckled and smiled throughout, but it was clear that, below the surface, some reckoning had ...</p></p><h2>Earwitness: Fifty characters (A Continuum book)</h2><p>Describes fifty personality types who embody modern behavior patterns from celebrity followers and neurotics obsessed with cleanliness to believers in the primacy of aesthetics and the religious self-righteous</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Trudeau and Our Times Volume 1</h2><p>Volume 1: The Magnificent Obsession<br><i>Winner of the Governor General&#x2019;s Award</i><br><br>This volume examines the formative influences on Pierre Trudeau&#x2019;s childhood, his knight-errant youth and early manhood, his charismatic ascent to the Liberal Party leadership, and his dramatic first decade as prime minister.

Everyone knows the story: The pre-teen daughters of the local minister are mysteriously overcome by convulsions, their uncontrollable screaming sending the superstitious community into fear and confusion. Lacking other explanations--adolescent rebellion, maybe?--Satanic influence is suspected, and accusations of witchcraft soon fly like enchanted broomsticks. The town is pitted against itself, and by the time the hysteria fades, 19 men and women are hanged, another pressed to death.</p> <p>But what actually happened? Pulitzer Prize-winner Stacy Schiff's <em>The Witches: Salem, 1692</em> steps back from more than three centuries of hyperbole and supposition, giving us our most complete account yet. It can't have been easy: As Schiff points out early in the book, the Puritans of Salem village were often assiduous diarists and record-keepers, but first-hand accounts of the months of the hysteria are mysteriously rare-and those that exist are mainly unreliable. To construct her history, Schiff went through the looking glass, compiling seemingly every fact available to create a historically accurate narrative of events while placing it within the cultural context of 17th century New England. The results are obvious: this book is dense with facts and a large cast of characters, and readers must commit. But Schiff keeps the proceedings rolling with wry humor and an eye for the peculiar-yet-illuminating detail. This isn't <em>The Crucible</em> or <em>Blair Witch</em>; it's light on sensationalism, but rife with real-life toil-and-trouble. The truth, as always, is strange enough.--<em>Jon Foro</em></p>Stacy Schiff is the author of <i>V�ra (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)</i>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize; <i>Saint-Exup�ry</i>, a Pulitzer Prize finalist; <i>A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America</i>, winner of the George Washington Book Prize and the Ambassador Book Award;<i> Cleopatra: A Life, </i>winner of the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for biography;<i> </i>and most recently,<i> The Witches:</i> <em>Salem, 1692</em>.

Almudena Grandes' writing has been compared to the work of classic and contemporary voices such as the Bront� sisters and Isabel Allende.</p><p>ALMUDENA GRANDES&#x2019;s Las Edades de Lulu (The Ages of Lulu) won the Sonrisa Vertical Prize for erotic fiction and was made into a film starring Javier Bardem. Grandes&#x2019;s novel Los Aires Dif�ciles debuted in the number one spot on Spanish bestseller lists when it was published in 2002, and remained on the lists for five months. Her books have been translated into over twenty languages.Sara Gomez Morales, 53, moves from Madrid to an Andalusian resort town to buy a house on a beach and do nothing. Her new neighbors include Juan Olmedo, a 40-year-old orthopedic surgeon fleeing Madrid for his own reasons. Flashbacks, which abound from early on, reveal that Sara was born poor in Madrid, but was raised by her rich godmother. As a young woman, Sara falls in love with and becomes pregnant by the married Vicente Gonzalez de Sandoval, a wealthy socialist, but she loses the child, and refuses to marry him when he divorces his wife. Years later, he helps her defraud her godmother of millions. Meanwhile, Juan's flashbacks center on his obsessive love for his deceased sister-in-law, Charo, and his sibling rivalry with his deceased brother, Damian. In the present, there's Maribel, the poorly educated cleaning woman both Sara and Juan look down upon (even as she becomes Sara's friend and Juan's lover), as well as Juan's 10-year-old niece, Tamara, and profoundly retarded brother, Alfonso. Grandes (<i>The Ages of Lul�</i>) sets it all up fascinatingly, but Sara's past seems disconnected from who she is today, and sloppy writing (or translation) obscures the rest. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But, wanting to bond with her popular new friends, Lissa and Penelope, she agrees to join them on a camping trip. At least Callie's sweet new boyfriend, Jeremy, will be coming too.<br><br> But nothing goes as planned. The group loses half their food supply. Then they lose their way. And with strange sounds all around her--the snap of a twig, a sinister laugh--Callie wonders if she's losing her mind. Tensions swirl among the group, with dark secrets suddenly revealed. And then, things take a fatal turn: Callie stumbles upon a cold dead body in the woods. Is the murderer close by, watching them? Callie has to figure out where she can turn and who she can trust, before her own life is at stake. Kieran Scott weaves a thrilling mystery that explores love, loyalty--and the dangerous decisions we make in order to survive.</p><p>Kieran Scott is the author of several acclaimed young adult novels, including <i>What Waits in the Woods</i>, the Cheerleader Trilogy, and the He's So / She's So Trilogy.

Visit her online at kieranscott.net.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Callie is the new girl, so when her new friends invite her on a camping and hiking trip, she can't say no, even though she has never been camping. The trip starts out fine, although a few spooky stories and her lack of outdoor experience have Callie on edge. Things begin to go south when the group gets hopelessly lost and it becomes obvious that there is someone following them. When the group meets a solo hiker who claims to know how to get to a trail and a cabin, they agree to follow him. Yet things continue downhill as their food dwindles, their trust of one another and their mysterious guide wears thin, and whatever is stalking them is closing in and threatening their lives. Most chapters end on a cliff-hanger, and entries from the stalker's "Recovery Journal" are interspersed throughout, so readers know that there is a killer but don't know the identity. Scott builds constant tension, and the novel's events unfold like a horror movie. There is some violence and a high body count, so this title is not for the faint of heart. This is a fast-paced thriller that will have readers on the edge of their seats.&#x2014;Ellen Norton, White Oak Library District, Crest Hill, IL</p><h2>A Clean Kill (The Reid Bennett Mysteries)</h2><p>There is no rest tonight for Reid Bennett, police chief of tiny Murphy&#x2019;s Harbor in Canada. Not if he keeps getting phone calls, that is. The first comes in from Amy Wilson. She&#x2019;s been brutally attacked on her arrival home from play rehearsal. The second has Reid breaking up a fight at a bar called Murphy&#x2019;s Arms. But the third call, about a dead body, is when things get complicated. The body belongs to one of the night&#x2019;s bar brawlers, an American tourist now stabbed to death in the road. It seems like there is an obvious murder suspect until another body shows up in the lake.<br><br>Are these murders and the attack somehow intertwined? Reid must wade carefully through the evidence and the witnesses, all the while juggling pressure from a hostile city council and unwelcome reporters. Add in the town play, bear baiters, and American evangelicals, and Reid has his hands more than full. Thankfully, he has got his dog Sam by his side.</p><p>Ted Wood was born in Shoreham, Sussex, England.

In this wide-ranging study, the distinguished Orthodox theologian, Metropolitan John (Zizioulas) of Pergamon, seeks to answer that question. In his celebrated book, <i>Being as Communion</i> (1985), he emphasised the importance of communion for life and for unity. In this important companion volume he now explores the complementary fact that communion is the basis for true otherness and identity. </p><br><p>With a constant awareness of the deepest existential questions of today, Metropolitan John probes the Christian tradition and highlights the existential concerns that already underlay the writings of the Greek fathers and the definitions of the early ecumenical councils. In a vigorous and challenging way, he defends the freedom to be other as an intrinsic characteristic of personhood, fulfilled only in communion.</p><br><p>After a major opening chapter on the ontology of otherness, written specially for this volume, the theme is systematically developed with reference to the Trinity, Christology, anthropology and ecclesiology. Another new chapter defends the idea that the Father is cause of the Trinity, as taught by the Cappadocian fathers, and replies to criticisms of this view. The final chapter responds to the customary separation of ecclesiology from mysticism and strongly favours a mystical understanding of the body of Christ as a whole. Other papers, previously published but some not easily obtainable, are all revised for their inclusion here.</p><br><p>This is a further contribution to dialogue on some of the most vital issues for theology and the Church from one of the leading figures in modern ecumenism.</p></p><p>John D.Zizioulas, Metropolitan of Pergamon, was previously Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of Glasgow and Visiting Professor at King's College, London. He is the author of <em>Communion and Otherness </em>(2006), and has been a major Orthodox contributor to modern ecumenical discussion. Paul McPartlan is Carl J. Peter Professor of Systematic Theology and Ecumenism at the Catholic University of America. <p>The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Rowan Williams is Archbishop of Canterbury. He was formerly Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Oxford and Archbishop of Wales.</p>"All who have benefitted from the influential insights of <em>Being as Communion </em>will be eager to read this new sequel, addressing the critical issue of the balance between relationality and difference in ontological thought." (Rev. John Polkinghorne)<br><br>"Metropolitan John Zizioulas is generally recognised as the most brilliant and creative theologian in the Orthodox Church today. The publication of a new book from his pen, supplementing his earlier master-work <i>Being as Communion, </i>is a major event, of the greatest interest to Western Christians as well as Orthodox. By exploring the theme of 'Otherness', he has developed in an original and illuminating way what he said in his earlier writings about Communion as the basis for personhood and church life. Here is a voice that greatly needs to be heard."<br><br>'On page after page of this outstanding book, our assumptions are challenged and our minds led back to the most deeply significant aspects of Christian faith, and to the conceptual and practical map drawn not only in Scripture but in the Greek Fathers, including the fathers of the desert and their teaching on practice and prayer. Few will read this book without sensing that they have been invited to rediscover Christianity itself in its richest traditional form.' (Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury)<br><br>'I'm now reading what I take to be the best book written by an Orthodox theologian in the last 20 years...John Zizioulas' <em>Communion and Otherness</em> is a masterpiece that is not only beautifully Eastern, but philosophically erudite and which engages meaningfully with Western theology. Herein Zizioulas further develops, refines, and defends his relational ontology of personhood that he first put forth in <em>Being as Communion</em>.' <br>Halden, Inhabitatio Dei Website Review (Halden, Inhabitatio Dei Website Review)<br><br>'John Zizioulas is always a challenging, but rewarding read. His theology of personhood and the implications it has for the doctrine of the Trinity, the church, the human being are difficult to match and his theology will continue to be one that others find helpful. He has done us a great service in drawing Western theology back to the Cappadocian Fathers. <em>Communion and Otherness</em> will surely join <em>Being as Communion</em> as a much read and much quoted book.'Andy Goodliff (Andy Goodliff)<br><br>"John Zizioulas, one of the most prominent contemporary Orthodox theologians, continues to develop his understanding of the relation between personhood and communion in eight essays, three published here for the first time. His thesis is that perfect union does not destroy but rather affirms otherness in the triune God, in the relationship between God and human persons and among the members of the Church...A 'must have' for personal and institutional libraries, this book should be used primarily in graduate studies. Zizioulas demonstrates that he is among the first-ranked contemporary theologians and that Orthodox theology is at a time of development influenced by its return to biblical, patristic, and liturgical sources, in a constructive encounter with other Christian theologies, contemporary philosophy, and modern society." -Radu Bordeianu, <em>Horizons</em>, Vol. 34, No. 2, Fall 2007 <br> (Radu Bordeianu)<br><br><em>'Communion and Otherness</em> is the product of a lifetime's work, the synthesis of Metropolitan John's thought...a book long awaited - and I believe rightly so - from a theologian who some consider to be a contemporary Church Father.'Liviu Barbu, King's College London, <em>Heythrop Journal</em> (<i>Heythrop Journal</i>)<br><br>"...this is not an easy read, but very much worth the effort...What I love most about this book is its sense of existence as God's gift to us and to all of creation, a gift Zizioulas places firmly in a eucharistic context. Because existence is a gift, he argues, atheism can be seen as a form of ingratitude. Faith means being grateful to every other being and finally to God himself, the ultimate Other and 'the author of all otherness. This kind of faith offers no security of rational conviction. The only certainty it offers lies in the love of the Other. The only proof of God's existence is his love-demonstrated by our very being, in otherness and communion. We are loved, therefore he exists.'"&#x2014;&#x2014; John Garvey, <em>Commonweal</em>, April 11, 2008 (John Garvey)<br><br>"...This volume, along with Being as Communion, provides one of the most insightful, contemporary and accessible accounts of Orthodoxy available." &#x2014; Thomas Finger, Christian Century, May 20, 2008 (Thomas Finger)<br><br>"This work is highly recommended for the upper level student, professor, and churchman or churchwoman seeking a deeper understanding of these important topics. Truly a challenging work." &#x2014;<em>Catholic Library World</em> (Cecil R. White)</p><h2>Baseball&#39;s First Stars</h2><p>From the Introduction: <p>Renewed interest in nineteenth century baseball&#x2014;just a trickle when SABR's pioneering <i>Nineteenth Century Stars</i> was published&#x2014;has become a steady stream. Every year since 1989 has seen the publication of one or more new books devoted entirely to the nineteenth century game, and books that treat the whole history of baseball are less likely than they were to undervalue the nineteenth century. It is even possible to witness authentic early baseball, as played by dozens of vintage ball clubs, many of them representing historic villages and museums.</p><p>Most of the persons profiled are players, but there are also umpires, managers, club owners, league officials and baseball writers. There are men as prominent as Albert Goodwill Spalding, who after a brilliant pitching career founded what became the dominant sporting goods company, and then wrote the first history of baseball. And Michael "King" Kelly, the game's first superstar, who inspired the song "Slide, Kelly, Slide." There are others whose names are no longer familiar, like William Cammeyer, who first had the bright idea of putting fence around a baseball park. And Al Spink, who founded <i>The Sporting News</i>. And pitched Bert Cunningham, who posted a losing record over all, but in one splendid season won more games than Cy Young&#x2014;for a team that finished 33 games out of first place. Cy Young is also here. So is Adrian Anson, an awesome hitter who was known as "Pop" by the end of his 27-year major league career, and George Stovey, an awesome pitcher who never played a single major league game because of the racist views of men like Anson. Two umpires called "Honest John"&#x2014;Gaffney and Kelly&#x2014;are profiled here, and no fewer than <i>four</i> "fathers of baseball': Alexander Cartwright, whose suggestion to his friends one day on a ball field led to the game we know today; Daniel L. "Doc" Adams, who biographer John Thorn argues is the "real" father of the game; Henry Chadwick, a journalist who, after his life was transformed by baseball, spent the next half century transforming baseball itself; and Harry Wright, the father of professional baseball, who made the pro game the wave of the future.</p></p><p></p><h2>Bed of nails: The story of the amazing Blondini.

In this collection, Remnick's gift for character is sharper than ever, whether he writes about Gary Hart stumbling through life after Donna Rice or Mario Cuomo, who now presides over a Saturday morning radio talk show, fielding questions from crackpots, or about Michael Jordan's awesome return to the Chicago Bulls -- or Reggie Jackson's last times at bat.<br><br>Remnick's portraits of such disparate characters as Alger Hiss and Ralph Ellison, Richard Nixon and Elaine Pagels, Gerry Adams and Marion Barry are unified by this extraordinary ability to create a living character, so that the pieces in this book, taken together, constitute a splendid pageant of the representative characters of our time.</p><p>David Remnick's previous book, <i>Lenin's Tomb</i>, was a razor-sharp portrayal of both the rulers and the ruled in the closing days of the Soviet Union. <i>The Devil Problem</i> pulls together profiles of athletes and politicians at the end of their careers (Reggie Jackson, Gary Hart), writers thriving in exile (Joseph Brodsky) and struggling in their homeland (Ralph Ellison), and scholars searching for the very origin of the devil (Elaine Pagels). Especially devastating is a profile of radio talk show host Mario Cuomo, who clearly preferred life as Governor of New York.

The conviction that death means everlasting extinction, with no possibility of an afterlife, is described by Peter Heinegg as "mortalism." In this unique anthology he has collected more than fifty selections of poetry and prose that reflect this view.<br><br>Contrary to what one might expect, mortalism does not invariably lead to pessimism, despair, or the sense that life is absurd. Although such sentiments are found in some of the quoted passages, many others give one the opposite impression: since life is brief and terribly finite, it should be treasured and celebrated for all its pleasures and rich experiences. Also noteworthy is the fact that the mortalist point of view is not necessarily confined to unbelievers. Heinegg presents quotations from Job, Ecclesiastes, the Venerable Bede, Blaise Pascal, and S�ren Kierkegaard, as well as from such unbelievers as Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud. <br> <br>Heinegg calls mortalism the great open secret of our culture&#x2014;open because the arguments in its favor are clear, powerful, and perfectly accessible, and a secret because acknowledging it has been seen either as impious or as simply too depressing to discuss. In perusing this intriguing volume the reader will find that mortalism was the viewpoint shared by many of the most profound and creative minds in history.</p><p>Peter Heinegg is professor of English and Comparative Literature at Union College in Schenectady, NY, and the translator of more than forty books.</p><h2>Woodworking for Wildlife: Homes for Birds and Mammals</h2><p><p>For everyone who enjoys attracting wildlife to their backyard, farm, woodlot, or lakeshore home, Woodworking for Wildlife is the perfect resource.

From the text that revealed the famous Theory of Relativity&#x201d;-renowned as the most important scientific discovery of the 20th Century-to his significant works on quantum theory, statistical mechanics, and the photoelectric effect, here are the writings that changed physics, and subsequently, the way we view the world. Einstein also thought deeply on both political issues and religious thought, so many of Einstein's philosophical essays are included. Hawking provides introductions to each work, which provides both historical and scientific perspective. From the papers that shaped modern scientific thought to Einstein's later musings on his landmark findings, <i>A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion</i> is a collection of Einstein's most important work, with commentary from our greatest living physicist.</p><p><b>Stephen Hawking</b>'s ability to make science understandable and compelling to a lay audience was established with the publication of his first book, <i>A Brief History of Time</i>, which has sold nearly 10 million copies in 40 languages. Hawking has authored or participated in the creation of numerous other popular science books, including <i>On the Shoulders of Giants</i> and <i>The Illustrated On the Shoulders of Giants.</i>Starred Review. It's hard to imagine a better guide to the work of Albert Einstein than Hawking, one of the world's most renowned physicists and popular science writers, whose own A Brief History of Time has sold over nine million copies. Though there are plenty of popular books about Einstein's theories, Hawking is right when he insists that the "most lucid, not to mention entertaining proponent of Einstein's ideas has always been Einstein himself." Even those with a minimal background in math and science will come away with a keen understanding of the towering genius and his transformative work on the nature of space, time and light. Included are Einstein's seminal papers on special and general relativity, and his 1916 Relativity, the Special and General Theory, which explains the theory in simple, straightforward terms accessible to any high-school graduate with a knowledge of basic algebra. Einstein's pioneering work in modern quantum theory, from his 1905 discovery of photons to his later, critical opinions of the generally accepted quantum theory (in excerpts from his 1950 book Out of My Later Years), is also considered. Hawking adds a brief but effective introduction to each section, making this gem of a collection really shine. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From her well-remembered New Yorker essays about the financial demands of big-city ambition and the ethereal, strangely old-fashioned allure of cyber relationships to her dazzlingly hilarious riff in Harper&#39;s about musical passions that give way to middle-brow paraphernalia, Daum delves into the center of things while closely examining the detritus that spills out along the way. She speaks to questions at the root of the contemporary experience, from the search for authenticity and interpersonal connection in a society defined by consumerism and media; to the disenchantment of working in a &#34;glamour profession&#34;; to the catastrophic effects of living among New York City&#39;s terminal hipsters. With precision and well-balanced irony, Daum implicates herself as readily as she does the targets that fascinate and horrify her. In a review of The KGB Bar Reader, in which Daphne Merkin singled out Daum&#39;s essay about the inability to mourn a friend&#39;s death, Merkin wrote: &#34;It&#39;s brutally quick, the way this happens, this falling in love with a writer&#39;s style.

His book about that event, Rehearsal for Invasion, was a best-seller, as were some of his other works which covered such unrelated subjects as rugby football, lavatories, David Frost and brassieres. This last, entitled Bust Up - The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra caused considerable confusion, especially in America and Canada. Flushed with Pride had been a great success and, as he could not think of any other famous inventor possessed of an amusingly-appropriate surname, he was inspired to create one. The story of Otto Titzling was clearly fictitious; unfortunately it was published in the same format as Flushed With Pride and contained similar illustrations and prose. This caused many American readers to assume that the biography of Mr. Crapper was also a joke which later led to extended correspondences in the letters pages of several publications. Thomas Crapper was dismissed as a hoax in various North American books and dictionaries of the early 1970s, but thankfully this mistake is rarely made to-day. Wallace Reyburn was very pleased when he learned that Thomas Crapper &amp; Co. Ltd. had survived. When he died at the age of 87 in 2001 his passing was justly marked by extensive and illustrated obituaries in, amongst others, The Times and the Daily Telegraph</p><h2>Love</h2><p>From the internationally acclaimed Nobel laureate comes a richly conceived audio that illuminates the full spectrum of desire.<br><br>May, Christine, Heed, Junior, Vida -- even L: all women obsessed by Bill Cosey. More than the wealthy owner of the famous Cosey Hotel and Resort, he shapes their yearnings for father, husband, lover, guardian, friend, yearnings that dominate the lives of these women long after his death.

Especially the tough ones with their box cutters and dirty language, or the glossy ones with two-seated cars and a pocketbook full of dope. Even the ones who wear scars like Presidential medals and stockings rolled at their ankles can&#x2019;t hide the sugar-child, the winsome baby girl curled up somewhere inside, between the ribs, say, or under the heart. -- from</i> <b>Love</b></p><p>The first page of Toni Morrison's novel <i>Love</i> is a soft introduction to a narrator who pulls you in with her version of a tale of the ocean-side community of Up Beach, a once popular ocean resort. Morrison introduces an enclave of people who react to one man--Bill Cosey--and to each other as they tell of his affect on generations of characters living in the seaside community. One clear truth here, told time and again, is how folks love and hate each other and the myriad ways it's manifested; these versions of humanity are seen in almost every line. Monsters and ghosts creep into young girls' dreams and around corners and then return to staid ladies' lives as they age and remember friendships and cold battles. Men and women--Heed, Romen, Junior, Christine, Celestial, and the rest of Morrison's cast--cry and sing out their weaknesses and strengths in rotating perspectives. Sandler, a Cosey employee, is a brilliant agent of Morrison's descriptions of human behavior, "Then, in a sudden shift of subject that children and heavy drinkers enjoy, 'My son, Billy was about your age. When he died, I mean.'" And Romen is allowed to play hero by saving a young girl from a brutal gang rape, while at the same time, he battles disgust like no superhuman would be caught dead feeling.<p> Though slim in pages, Morrison constructs <i>Love</i> with a precision and elegance that shows her characters' flaws and fears with brutal accuracy. <i>Love</i> may be less complex than others in the grand Morrison oeuvre, but not because Morrison performs literary hand-holding. Readers will experience in this smooth, sharp-eyed gem another instance of the Toni Morrison craftsmanship: she enters your mind, hangs a tale or two there, and leaves just as quietly as she came. <i>--E.

An introductory essay explores the synergy between graphic design and photography, and the dynamic relationship that exists between words and pictures. Anecdotal captions provide philosophic comments on the nature of the photographs, aspects of the page design and observations on the process of assembling parts to form a whole.

The voices say they are calling from heaven. Each call is greeted differently&#x2014;some with love, some with religious zeal, some with fear.

His most recent release is The Longest Ride</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Nicholas Sparks: </strong>We first met years ago, when <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> and <i>The Notebook</i> were just out. What&#x2019;s been the most surprising turn for your career since that day?</p> <p><strong>Mitch Albom:</strong> Pretty much everything. <i>Tuesdays</i> was the first nonsports thing I had done, and it was written only to pay Morrie&#x2019;s medical bills. I figured I&#x2019;d return to sportswriting. I never imagined novels or the audience I&#x2019;ve been blessed to find. I remember you hoping <i>The Notebook</i> would give you more chances to write. I think you&#x2019;ve done OK with that, by the way.</p> <p><strong>NS: </strong>Thanks. With this new novel, The <i>First Phone Call from Heaven</i>, heaven once again figures prominently&#x2014;as it did in <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i>. How do you use it differently this time?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> <i>Five People</i> mostly takes place in heaven, to teach Eddie, the protagonist, to appreciate his life on earth. <i>First Phone Call</i> takes place in a small town, with the idea of heaven reaching out to us down here&#x2014;through the phone.</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> You wove the story of Alexander Graham Bell&#x2019;s invention of the telephone into this novel. Do you see parallels between that and our modern-day obsession with cell phones? How did this influence your story development?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> People scoffed at the telephone&#x2019;s invention. Yet once it was introduced, its growth was astronomical. Same thing with cell phones. I used this to show how the &#x201c;once impossible&#x201d; is quickly forgotten. Could the same be true about speaking to heaven?</p> <p><strong>NS: </strong>Hearing from a deceased loved one is such a powerful idea. Whom would you talk to if you had the chance? And if Morrie from <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> were one, what would you ask him? </p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> My mother is still alive, but has suffered several strokes and can&#x2019;t speak. I wish I could dial to the past and engage in one of our long, impassioned, all-over-the-place talks. And Morrie? Well. He never got to read a page of <i>Tuesdays</i>. I&#x2019;d ask if he is pleased. Am I doing OK by him? Mostly, I&#x2019;d like to hear his laughter. I think we miss laughter most. </p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> This is the first novel you&#x2019;ve written with a mystery/thriller element. Did that change your writing process at all? And is this how you think the world would really react&#x2014;global fascination&#x2014;if proof of heaven were somehow revealed?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> It felt quite natural to weave a mystery&#x2014;perhaps from all those years&#x2019; writing sports that count down and reach a climax. And yes, I definitely think if a town today claimed to be talking to heaven, it would be on twenty-four hours a day on cable news and the Internet. Look at the Susan Boyle story. In a week, the whole world knew of her&#x2014;and she just sang like an angel. Imagine talking to one!</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> Small towns&#x2014;like Coldwater in <i>First Phone Call</i>&#x2014;often paint the backdrop of your novels. Why?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> I was raised in a small town&#x2014;local high school, one great pizza place, everyone knowing everyone. So it&#x2019;s familiar. Also, secrets in a small town are hard to keep&#x2014;and often shocking when revealed. My stories are about people&#x2014;and sometimes secrets. A small town is a good canvas.</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> Now that you have so many more books than just <i>Morrie</i>&#x2014;unlike when we first met&#x2014;do you have a favorite among them?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> <i>Tuesdays</i> will always be my favored child&#x2014;because it so changed my life. But storywise, <i>Five People</i> means a great deal, because everyone told me I was crazy&#x2014;don&#x2019;t write a novel. I broke every piece of advice. And people embraced the story. That&#x2019;s extremely rewarding.</p><p><em>"What if the end is not the end?" </em></p><p>From the beloved author of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em> and <em>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</em> comes his most thrilling and magical novel yet&#x2014;a page-turning mystery and a meditation on the power of human connection.</p><p>One morning in the small town of Coldwater, Michigan, the phones start ringing.

Each of the book's stories of seafaring disaster��many little known, all exciting and of deep human interest��presents a broad human drama. Rousmaniere tells of the hopes and choices that put these sailors in harm's way. He takes readers into the gales themselves with authoritative knowledge of horrific weather and the split-second decisions that seamen must make. Finally, he explores the consequences of these disasters for survivors, rescuers, families, communities, and in some cases nations. The pursuit of these elusive strands leads the reader deep into our ambivalent relationship with the sea as both "destroyer and preserver."</p></p><p>Few stories have more power to thrill and horrify than those of human struggle against storms at sea--frail sailors in their cockleshell ships fighting a chaotic, overwhelming force that, John Rousmaniere tells us, can be "as indifferent to normal order as a war." When the last survivor is ashore and the last victim is memorialized, we feel horror and also relief. But though the storm may last only hours, the roots of the storm story reach far back in time, and the consequences ripple outward long after the last wave rolls by. The real stories of people and ships, of dreams and seamanship, of loss and recovery are richer, deeper, more complex, and at once more disturbing and rewarding than a mere headline suggests. <p>John Rousmaniere is considered by many to have originated the storm-writing genre with his classic Fastnet, Force 10, which the Los Angeles Times praised as "a narrative worthy of the best sea literature." In his new book, his most ambitious work ever, he takes storm stories to a new level of revelation and universality. After the Storm is the expression of a master storyteller and the ultimate consequence of Rousmaniere's own experience in the Fastnet storm. "I can testify that storms change lives," he says in the Introduction, "because one changed mine." </p><p>In the book's interrelated stories, he tells of the hopes and choices that put sailors in harm's way, and then takes us into the gales themselves with authoritative knowledge of horrific weather and the split-second decisions that seafarers must make in appalling conditions. He explores the consequences of these disasters for survivors, rescuers, families, communities, and, in some cases, nations. And he shows how storm experiences shape reputations and beliefs, often creating myths springing from the hunger for explanation. </p><p>The pursuit of these interconnected strands draws the reader deep into our ambivalent relationship with the sea as both "destroyer and preserver." The stories include a tragedy that destroyed a prominent Boston family; the Pacific typhoon that stopped America's first war with Germany; the disappearance of the Portland--"New England's Titanic"; the worst noncombatant disaster in U.S. Navy history; the stormy deaths of a poet (Percy Bysshe Shelley) and a visionary (Margaret Fuller); the gale that redeemed a prophet after nearly destroying him; the storm off Newfoundland that inspired the hymn "Amazing Grace"; and two wrenching tales of derelict ships. </p><p>With all the harrowing twists of the best adventure writing and the shattering impact of a storm at sea, After the Storm is a moving, provocative exploration of the roots and consequences of sudden tragedy in human affairs. It keeps searching after other storm books end. </p><p>"A thinking person's Perfect Storm.

Since his arrival in New York in 1956, Oldenburg&#x2019;s prolific production has always been accompanied by a daily practice of writing that reveals the conceptual complexity and diversity of his inventive oeuvre.<br><br>Comprising the artist&#x2019;s key writings from the late 1950s and 1960s, this volume makes available a wealth of previously unpublished material, including sections of the diary Oldenburg kept during these formative years, his notes (written on an old typewriter in his studio while standing), facsimiles of sketches that show his abiding interest in the relationship between image and language, plus statements, essays, scripts for Happenings and poems. In diverse styles, vivid descriptions of his environment alternate with intimate confessions, humorous anecdotes, psychological observations and self-analysis, characterizations of the art world and its protagonists, and recurring inquests into his own motivations.<br><br>This compilation, the first to be dedicated entirely to Oldenburg&#x2019;s writings, shows an artist who is not only resolute, informed, and programmatic--deeply concerned with the art and society of his time--but also witty and playful in his confrontation with his own contradictions and ambiguities. The book provides a unique window into the formation and evolution of one of the most influential and ground- breaking contemporary artists, and a lively personal account of the 1960s.<br><br>Born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1929, <b>Claes Oldenburg</b> grew up in Chicago and graduated from Yale University in 1950. After studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, he settled permanently in New York City in 1956. Oldenburg established himself in the early 1960s with a series of installations and performances, among them &#x201c;The Street&#x201d; (1960), &#x201c;The Store&#x201d; (1961) and &#x201c;The Ray Gun Theater&#x201d; (1962). At the end of the decade, Oldenburg began to fabricate works on a large scale, beginning with &#x201c;Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks&#x201d; (1969), which was followed by other works such as &#x201c;Geometric Mouse&#x201d; (1969) and &#x201c;Giant Ice Bag&#x201d; (1970). His first architecturally scaled sculpture, the 45-foot-high &#x201c;Clothespin,&#x201d; was installed in downtown Philadelphia in 1976. Soon thereafter, he began working with Coosje van Bruggen, whom he married in 1977. Together they went on to realize 44 site-specific sculptures for cities in the United States, Europe, Japan and Korea.</p><p></p><h2>The Conquerors</h2><p>The Conquerors, the third volume in Allan Eckert's acclaimed series, The Winning of America, continues the narrative of The Frontiersmen and Wilderness Empire: the violent and monumental story of the wresting of the North American continent from the Indians. But the locale has moved westward&#x2014;to the northern frontiers of Pennsylvania, to Michigan and the Green Bay area, especially the crucial outposts of Fort Pitt and Fort Detroit, Sandusky and Mackinac. <p>Wilderness Empire concluded with the English victory in the French and Indian War, a conquest which gave them possession of an immense North American empire. Now English soldiers and traders began the trek across the wilderness to man the former French outposts, to secure the land for the Crown and to exploit its riches. But these men were to find that the conquest of the Northwest did not end with the defeat of the French. The Indians had only resentment for the English, whom they regarded not as conquerors, but as unwelcome interlopers on their own ancestral lands. At last, provoked beyond endurance by restrictive policies, and encouraged by agents of the French, the most powerful tribes of the region united behind the charismatic Pontiac, war chief of the Ottawa, in a concerted effort to drive the English forever form the Northwest. </p><p>The Conquerors is the story of Pontiac's uprising and the men involved in it: the conquering English, both soldiers and intrepid civilians, who undertook the dangers of the Indian trade for profit and the adventure of opening a new land; and, most importantly, the Indians, who refused to accept the yoke of the conquered and were driven to violence to protect their homes and their way of life from the encroachment of an alien civilization. </p><p>Combining the accuracy of a chronicle and the spellbinding pace of a story well told, Allan Eckert evokes the high drama of the conquest of the Northwest and the breathtaking grandeur of the land itself.</p></p><p>They had defeated the French and now the English possessed the vast North American Empire. Soldiers, traders, settlers--all began the trek across the wilderness to claim the land and its riches.

From his &#x201c;flavor of the month&#x201d; status with his debut film <i>sex, lies, and videotape</i> to his Academy Award-winning feature <i>Traffic</i>, Soderbergh's road to success is fraught with ups and downs.<br><br> On each and every film, the book details such experiences as his creative crisis surrounding his fourth film, <i>The Underneath</i>, and his rejuvenation with the ultra-low budget free-style <i>Schizopolis</i>, and the mainstream achievements that followed with <i>Erin Brockovich</i> and <i>Traffic</i>.<br><br> Spanning twelve years, these conversations reveal Soderbergh (b. 1963) to be as self-effacing and lighthearted in his later more established years as he was when just starting out. He comes across as a man undaunted by the glitz and power of Hollywood, remaining, above all, a truly independent filmmaker unafraid to get his hands dirty and pick up the camera himself.<br><br> Not only do the interviews provide a glimpse into the filmmaker's aesthetics, but they also offer a history of the US independent film movement in the late 1980s and 1990s&#x2015;the explosion of &#x201c;independent films,&#x201d; studios and film festivals, and the Hollywood co-optation of such talents, Soderbergh included.

Translations of 976 texts (compared with 626 in the German edition) are cited that directly illustrate the religious world into which early Christianity was born. Many of the texts are extensive enough to give a thorough sampling of how, for instance, miracle stories and birth stories of quasi-divine beings were told in the Hellenistic world, and how revelatory or conversion experiences were expressed in Greco-Roman religions. The texts are arranged according to the canonical order of New Testament books. Thorough cross-references and indexes make it easy to locate texts relevant to the interpretation of any New Testament text or theme. Each text is provided with annotations suggesting ways in which it might illuminate the New Testament text. Furthermore, the new introduction to the English edition specifies ways in which the treasures of these texts might be unlocked, as well as pointing to dangers in their superficial use. The original German introduction provides helpful categories for the application of these texts to New Testament interpretation.</p><p>M. Eugene Boring is I Wylie and Elizabeth M.

Accompanying her grandmother on a seniors tour of Switzerland, Emily Andrew had envisioned a vacation straight out of a travel brochure: spectacular scenery, great food, and a classy European hotel, all worlds away from her rural Iowa hometown. But her dream trip quickly snowballs into mayhem when smooth-talking tour escort Andy Simon is found dead. To be sure, Andy was as randy as a mountain goat on Viagra, hitting on every miss -- Swiss or otherwise -- within striking distance. His constant advances were driving Emily cuckoo -- but had someone orchestrated his untimely death? For savvy, resourceful Emily, leading the tour in Andy&#39;s place is only natural. But she can&#39;t remain neutral when a fellow traveler takes a fatal plunge -- she&#39;s convinced a murderer lurks among them. With precision timing, sexy Etienne Miceli steps in to investigate, and Emily warms to the suave detective. Still, with the group roster suddenly sprouting more holes than the local cheese, Emily wonders: is there a safe haven anywhere in the shadow of the Alps?</p><p><b>Maddy Hunter</b> has endured disastrous vacations on three continents in the past five years.

She lives with her husband in Madison, Wisconsin.<p><b><br> </b></p><p><b> "I am NOT sleeping with Andrew Simon for the next nine days!" My voice hovered at a pitch that could cause spontaneous insanity in dogs. I was squeezing the tour guide's forearm so tightly, his fingers had turned purple. "Major mix-up in the room assignments. MAJOR mix-up." I might have added that had I wanted to sleep with Andy Simon, I wouldn't have had to fly all the way to Switzerland to do it. I would have done it back in Iowa, like everyone else. But why ruin a man's reputation when he was doing such a good job of it himself? </b></p><p><b> The tour guide, who'd introduced himself at the Zurich airport as Wally, slid his attention from the hand I'd manacled around his arm, to my chest. A stunned look appeared in his eye. And why not? Thanks to the genius of Victoria's Secret, those of us who were modestly endowed could now flaunt awe-inspiring bosom beneath our turtlenecks. I had to watch myself though. My Click Miracle bra was set on maximum cleavage, so if I stood any closer, I'd poke his eye out. </b></p><p><b> "Have you misplaced your name tag already?" Wally chided. "It's supposed to hang right there, in the middle of your chest." </b></p><p><b> Wally was your typical boy next door with a few pounds on his bones and lines on his face. Beaver Cleaver at thirty-five. Brown hair. Receding hairline. Hazel eyes with no apparent eyelashes. Chipmunk cheeks. Pudgy around the middle. But he was half a head taller than I am, wore a suit that smacked of custom-made rather than off-the-rack, and he wasn't wearing a wedding ring. He had serious potential. However, if the only thing he noticed about my chest was the absence of a name tag, I figured we didn't have much of a future together. I consoled myself with the fact that he probably wasn't my type. </b></p><p><b> Of course, I had no idea what my type was anymore. The issue had gotten confused when I'd met Jack Potter seven years ago. I'd graduated from college with a degree in theater and was trying to peddle my talents as an actress in New York City. To pay the rent, I took a job as a ticket seller at Radio City Music Hall, where I worked beside Jack. We had so much in common, I suspected we were soul mates. He was an aspiring actor. So was I. He loved to shop. So did I. He was compulsively neat. I picked up after myself occasionally. And since both of us were having trouble choosing between eating or paying the rent each month, we decided to pool our resources and share an apartment. </b></p><p><b> The roommate thing might have worked if Jack hadn't had the body of a dancer and the face of a Roman god, or if I hadn't been consumed by raging hormones and lust. Within a year we became husband and wife. More good fortune struck when we were both offered parts in <i>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.</i> Me, in the chorus. Jack as one of the brothers. But things deteriorated when he started borrowing my lingerie and makeup, not just for shows, but on a daily basis. Six months later he pulled a disappearing act and ran off with the actor who played Joseph's understudy. I moved back to Iowa after that, a little older and wiser, but my romantic life has been muddled ever since. </b></p><p><b> I squeezed Wally's arm a little harder. "My name is Emily Andrew. I don't wear name tags. And I don't sleep with married men." </b></p><p><b> Wally wrenched his arm from my grasp. "Do you mind? I have no feeling in my hand anymore. And look, you crushed the press on my sleeve." He gave his arm a vigorous rub and me an exasperated look. "We encourage all our Golden Swiss Triangle Tour members to wear their name tags, but of course, we can't force you." He looked me up and down, eyeing me like meat on the hoof. </b></p><p><b> I exercised regularly to keep cellulite from attaching itself to my five-foot-five-inch, 112-pound frame, so I knew I looked pretty decent in my favorite black leather skirt with the little slit up the side. But my hair was problematic. Not the color, which was a deep mahogany, but the texture. The minute a hint of humidity crept into the air, my coarse, wavy, shoulder-length hair acquired the kind of frizz that straight-haired people only achieved by sticking their fingers into electrical outlets. Since it was raining in Lucerne today, it was only a matter of time before I morphed into Little Orphan Annie, only with green eyes instead of the empty sockets. </b></p><p><b> "Aren't you a little young to be on a Golden Tour?" Wally finally asked. </b></p><p><b> "Traveling companion," I said. "I'm with my grandmother." </b></p><p><b> Nana belonged to a seniors' travel club run by the bank in Windsor City. The bank scheduled tours through a national company called Triangle Tours that arranged transportation, lodging, and a professional tour guide in the country of destination. Since many of the seniors were novices at foreign travel, the bank also provided a local escort to cater to the individual needs of the group. Nana invited me to accompany her on the trip because she said I'd be less bossy than my mother and a lot more fun than the other seventy-eight-year-olds in her retirement village. So being a sucker for flattery, I turned my back on the lure of Club Med for the opportunity to spend nine days in Switzerland with thirty white-haired seniors who made twenty-nine look young. </b></p><p><b> "Now," continued Wally, "who did you say you don't want to sleep with?" </b></p><p><b> "Look, Wally, someone made a mistake. I'm supposed to room with my grandmother, not Andrew Simon. In case you didn't know, Mr. Simon is our escort from the Windsor City Bank. He's being paid to accompany the group, not sleep with the guests." </b></p><p><b> Someone sneezed loudly behind me. I felt a hand caress the back of my neck. "Emily, honey, I just heard the good news. How do you suppose an old coot like me got lucky enough to room with the prettiest little trick on the tour?" </b></p><p><b> Andrew Simon was short, stocky, and stuck on himself. His year-round tan was out of a tube. His hair color was out of a bottle -- Surfer Blonde, which was something of an anomaly considering the only surfing you can do in Iowa is on the Internet. He'd married his sixth wife, Louise, three years earlier, and since then had whiled away his time swinging golf clubs by day and rehearsing lines for the local community theater by night. Louise was sister to the Windsor City Bank president, which explained how Simon had landed himself the cushy job of escort on the Golden Swiss Triangle Tour. He'd left Louise back in Windsor City, however, since the thought of flying gave her hives and caused her windpipe to swell shut. Not a good way to begin your Golden Swiss holiday. </b></p><p><b> I snatched his hand from my neck and stood toe-to-toe with him, our noses separated by bare inches, my chest every bit as inflated as his ego. "There's been a mistake. Your first name, my last name. Some out-of-touch administrator must have thought we were family and stuck us in the same room together. What's wrong with your eyes?" They were painfully bloodshot and weepy. "Are you contagious?" I took a giant step backward. He'd probably contracted a fatal disease on the plane and was infecting everyone within a six-mile radius. Bad idea for a holiday. Arrive in Switzerland. Die. </b></p><p><b> "It's that damned air on the plane. I shouldn't have worn my contact lenses. The pharmacist warned me, but I didn't listen. My eyes are so itchy, I feel like I have the worst case of hay fever in medical history." </b></p><p><b> He looked as if he had the worst case of bubonic plague in medical history. I inched back another step. I didn't want to be within hearing range when he peeled off his lenses. They'd probably dried out so badly, they were superglued to his eyeballs by now. </b></p><p><b> "About the room assignments, Emily, I don't know how that could have happened. The bank made all those arrangements. Frieda saw to it personally, and Frieda never makes a mistake." </b></p><p><b> Frieda Olson had been a fixture at the bank since the first ice age. At eighty-five she was still sharp as a tack and drove into work daily, but her glasses were thick as pond ice, which cast serious doubt on her ability to process paperwork. "I suspect you filled your travel form out incorrectly," I accused. He'd probably written ANDREW in the space for LAST NAME and SIMON in the space for FIRST NAME, which would conveniently give us the same surname and room assignment. </b></p><p><b> "Emily, honey, why would I do that?" </b></p><p><b> "Because I'm female and conscious?" </b></p><p><b> "Emily Andrew, are you hinting that I planned this mix-up?" His gaze drifted to my chest. It made me wish Victoria's Secret had come out with a padded underwire that lifted, separated, and launched rocket grenades. I seized Wally's arm again. </b></p><p><b> "Wally here is going to fix the problem. Aren't you, Wally?" </b></p><p><b> "Emily, dear! Don't bother our tour guide. I've worked everything out myself." Nana, who dutifully wore a name tag identifying her as Marion Sippel, was four-foot-ten, built like a bullet, and still wore her hair in tight finger waves that had been fashionable in the sixties. "I been talkin' to that nice Mr. Nunzio over there. I couldn't understand everything he was sayin' 'cause he don't speak real good English, but I think he said he'd share the room with me if you'd found another roommate. Italians are so hospitable." </b></p><p><b> I'd scanned the roster of travelers on the flight over, but I didn't remember seeing a Nunzio. Nunzio I would have remembered. "Where is this Mr. Nunzio?" </b></p><p><b> Nana pointed to a marble pillar in the middle of the hotel lobby. "He's the gentleman wearin' the black trench coat. Standin' beside Bernice Zwerg." </b></p><p><b> I stood on tiptoe. But for the absence of a print cloth draped about his head, Mr. Nunzio was a Yasser Arafat look-alike -- hair like a cactus, face like a ferret, knees like old potatoes. Knees? "He's not wearing trousers." Leave it to Nana. Three hours in Switzerland, and she'd managed to find what was possibly the only Italian pervert in the entire country. </b></p><p><b> "I did notice about the trousers, dear, but this is Europe. I thought he was makin' a fashion statement." </b></p><p><b> "Mr. Nunzio isn't on our tour, Nana. He'll have to room with someone else." I said this with more calm than I felt because if I let anything happen to Nana, my mother would kill me. </b></p><p><b> Nana looked disappointed. She was the most accommodating person I'd ever known. She'd hauled wood before the days of electricity, hauled water before the days of indoor plumbing, and hauled tail out of Minnesota after the roof of Grampa's ice shanty collapsed, killing him and the thirty-pound muskie he'd been struggling to pull in for the better part of the afternoon. She had them both laid out at the wake -- Grampa Sippel in a cherry casket and the muskie on a bed of crushed ice. The whole town of Brainerd, Minnesota, turned out for the viewing, and everyone in attendance had the same thing to say about Grampa: he'd caught the plug-ugliest fish ever to swim the waters of Gull Lake. </b></p><p><b> Nana moved to Iowa afterward to be closer to my parents, my married brother and his family, and me. She arrived a wealthy widow, not because Grampa was a piker who'd squirreled away every penny he ever earned, but because she won the lottery jackpot on the day Grampa's ice shanty collapsed.

He was an expert at reading his father&#x2019;s mercurial moods and gauging exactly when his mother was likely to erupt, and even before he learned to ride a bike, he was often forced to take matters into his own hands. He broke up his parents&#x2019; raucous New Year&#x2019;s Eve party with gunfire and ended their slugfest at the local drive-in (actual restaurants weren&#x2019;t on the Crowells&#x2019; menu) by smashing a glass pop bottle over his own head.<br><br>Despite the violent undercurrents always threatening to burst to the surface, he fiercely loved his epilepsy-racked mother, who scorned boring preachers and improvised wildly when the bills went unpaid.

He lives in Nashville.<br><br>www.rodneycrowell.comChapter 1<br><br>New Year's Eve, 1955<br><br>The four beer-blitzed couples dancing in the cramped living room of my parents' shotgun duplex were wearing on my nerves. In particular, I didn't like the sound of their singing along with my prized Hank Williams 78s. Coon hunting with my grandfather, I'd heard bluetick hounds howl with more intonation than this nasal pack of yahoos. For a while I tried contenting myself with sticking my fingers in my ears and staring squinty-eyed at the scuff-mark patterns forming on the linoleum, hoping a likeness of Jesus or Eisenhower-the only famous images I knew of at the time other than "ole Hank," as my father and I referred to our favorite singer-would stare up at me from beneath the dancers' feet. But when all I could summon up was a swarm of black stubby snakes, I gave up and went back to being in a funk.<br><br>The next thing I remember, Cookie Chastain was screeching to be heard above the scratchiness of whichever record she'd just gored with the blunt end of the phonograph needle. "Twenty minutes till midnight. Everybody change partners." And while the rest of the gang bumped around and groped for whom to dance with next, she was making a big deal out of sashaying into the waiting arms of the one man whose lust for oblivion I knew could turn this little shindig into a repeat of my worst nightmare. By then I'd guzzled most of the six-pack of Cokes I'd discovered in the icebox and was no longer ready to pretend that this New Year's Eve nonsense was anything but a recipe for disaster. My mother was mad as a hornet, but too ashamed to make a scene just yet; Mr. Chastain and the others were too wasted to notice or care; and my father, the only real singer in the bunch, had once again lowered his standards to a level that guaranteed trouble.<br><br>I'd been privy to the shadowy undercurrents detailed in my mother and father's all-night shouting matches long enough to know that drunk husbands and wives swapping two-steps with other drunk wives and husbands, though a time-honored Texas tradition, was anything but harmless fun. I could never grasp what she accused him of doing with Lila May Strickland or Pauline Odell, but I knew by her disdain for the word "screwing" that nothing good ever came of the deed. And it got more complicated when she started screaming about how he'd even screw a light socket if one could spread its legs for him. Grown-ups were weird.<br><br>Unlike my father, I was beginning to understand that all this business about who or what he was supposedly screwing served a darker purpose for my mother: setting up yet another reprise of the brain-scalding accusation that he'd belt-whipped her across the belly when, eight months pregnant with me, she stood naked in the bathtub.<br><br>The scene is seared in my mind as if I'd actually been able to witness it. A sliver of July dusk creeps in under the canvas window shade, and the dangling circle on the end of its pull string is tapping against the yellowed wallpaper beneath the sill. On the back of the door, an ancient hot-water bottle gives off traces of vinegar douche, mementos from a time before I entered the picture. There's the buck-stitched cowboy belt and fake trophy buckle; for years I imagined a silver- headed rattlesnake in the grip of an escaped convict, though I've yet to conjure how he managed, in a space half the size of a prison cell, to wield the thing. And veiled in a sepia gauze, courtesy of the light fixture above the medicine cabinet, is my mother, naked as Eve, dripping wet and cowering in the claw-footed tub, stillbirth emblazoned across her frontal lobe. But whose memory is this in which I can see these things so clearly yet can't place my father? His? Hers? Or mine?<br><br>I despised my mother's need to belittle my father in my eyes as much as I hated his refusal to deny wielding this belt. To accept her version as fact, which I did, and never believing his trademark "Aw, hell, Cauzette, you know I did no such a thing" meant embracing the possibility that it could all happen again. Together, my parents made it impossible to keep my father on the pedestal where I needed him most. And about that, all I can tell you is this: I'd be well within range of the truth if I said there were times I was mad enough to kill them both.<br><br>I'd been sleeping in the living room longer than I could remember, my mother making a nightly ritual of "fixin' [me] up a pallet" on the sofa. In the early days, the kitchen chair she positioned to keep me from rolling off onto the floor simulated a perfectly good crib. Still, the shame of my not having a bedroom of my own was particularly hard on her. Other than dying and going to heaven, the dream of a nursery for her only living child was her lone investment in the promise of a better future. As far as I was concerned, this was a waste of wishful thinking; I much preferred my arrangement on the couch to the mildewed cave that was the front bedroom.<br><br>Conditions surrounding my parents' beer-and-baloney soiree made the crossing of some invisible line in their ongoing war of hard words and physical abuse a foregone conclusion. As much as I hated the discomfort of having my territory invaded by mindless adults, I dreaded even more my inability to escape the hellish crescendo I knew would follow when my father started chasing beer with whiskey.<br><br>But no refuge was to be found in the front bedroom, whose dark shadows and damp spookiness scared me witless. Wallpaper hung from the ceiling in stained ragged strands, like a cross between witch hair and brown cotton candy. The jaundiced glow of the exposed overhead lightbulb fell far short of its four corners, where untold evil lurked. Should I find myself alone in that room, the cardboard windowpanes, creaky floors, and lumpy thirty-year-old mattress were the least of my worries.<br><br>Traffic to and from the party's beer supply rendered the kitchen in back of the house a useless hideout, likewise the bathroom where I could have played with my toy cars on the floor. Left to idle in the narrow hallway between the living room and the bedroom, I began to hatch a plan.<br><br>My intention to break up the party, before it reached the point that my parents had time and again proven themselves unable to return from without inflicting damage, didn't necessarily include subjecting their guests to bodily harm. I liked Doc and Dorothy Lawrence, Pete and Wanda Faye Conn, Paul and Cookie Chastain as sober adults. Just the same, the job of saving my parents from themselves called for drastic measures, and innocent bystanders couldn't be helped.<br><br>My father kept a loaded pump-action 16-gauge and a .22-caliber rifle stashed in the bedroom closet. Such an arrangement was as natural to him as breathing the night air. Childhood in the Depression-era backwoods of western Kentucky had left him ingrained with the notion- contrary to his wife's-that a boy was never too young to put food on the table. On the morning of my fifth birthday, I awoke to find him cleaning the shotgun. While examining his handiwork, he broached the subject for the first time. "Son," he said, affecting more profundity than I was used to hearing, "in this old world of snakebites and hunger pain, a man's aim's 'bout as close as he's gonna get to a paid- up insurance policy. They ain't many scores that cain't be settled with a load of buckshot." My mother argued rather convincingly that in East Houston in the midfifties, squirrel and rabbit were in such short supply that knowledge of small firearms was about as useful as the ability to speak Portuguese. But she was told where she could stick Portuguese, and with that the discussion ended. Later in the day, he borrowed Little Willie Smith's shiny black '49 Ford Roadster and drove Grandpa Willoughby and me to a pine thicket north of Old Wallisville Road, where I was given my first lesson with a single-shot .22.<br><br>My decision to fish the .22 from the closet wasn't made lightly. To retrieve the gun meant entering the room alone, a chilling prospect even in broad daylight. But sensing the storm gathering behind the rising levels of alcohol, I figured those dark corners were no match for what would happen if the adults out there started screwing each other.<br><br>Aside from enhancing the gravity of my announcement that it was time to go home, I had no intention of using the gun. Based loosely on the Saturday matinees I'd seen at the Navaway Theater, where the good guy got the bad guy's attention by wielding a six-shooter full of silver bullets, my plan required the gun as a prop.<br><br>Hank Williams was singing "Lovesick Blues" when I stepped into the living room armed with my father's rifle. Dorothy Lawrence was the first to notice my arrival. "My Lord, he's got a gun!" she called out, a bit less dramatically than I'd have liked but compelling nonetheless. The focus of attention shifted instantly in my direction, and having all eyes on me sent a surge of power through my nervous system that left my mind a small blank canvas. From there, the script unraveled.<br><br>It was lack of preparation for this pivotal moment that provoked two serious blunders: one, inadvertently disengaging the thumb-activated safety on the rifle; two, pointing it at my father and pulling the trigger. The bullet exploded into the linoleum floor less than a foot from where Dorothy stood. "Lovesick Blues" came to a screeching halt, and my father pounced on me like he was Batman on pep pills. Sensing his first impulse was to beat me with the butt of the rifle, I braced myself for the worst. Instead, he hugged me so close to his heart that even through the ringing in my ears I could hear it pounding. Being squeezed so hard that I could barely breathe gave me a feeling of comfort. My peacekeeping mission was complete. There would be no fighting that night.<br><br>Shocking people sober and sending them home thankful to be alive is one way to break up a party. Although visibly shaken, my parents' friends showed no ill feelings. Cookie Chastain said she knew I was "a good boy and wouldn't hurt a flea." Pete Conn reckoned I "knew not to play with no more loaded guns." Doc Lawrence went as far as making a joke about my aim being so bad that I was "lucky not to have shot [my] dang pecker off." Hushed exits, however, told the story of how they really felt.<br><br>My parents never asked why I chose to wave a loaded rifle around a room full of people, let alone pull the trigger. Their joint lecture on involuntary manslaughter suggested they were filing the experience away under the harmless "Child Plays with Father's Gun" heading. I wanted to tell them my true intentions, that it was all their fault, that I was sick of being stuck in the middle of their stupid shouting matches, that their friends needed singing lessons. Seeing them work as a team held this impulse in check. At that moment, volunteering information seemed as great a waste of ammunition as the .22 slug lodged in the floorboards.<br><br>On the surface, a temporary halt in my parents' conflict and a hole in the linoleum was all I had to show for my shooting spree. Beneath that, my success was more far-reaching. Ten-plus years of knock-down- drag-outs were still to be accounted for, but from that day on my father refused to allow a loaded gun in the house, a decision that perhaps saved his life and my mother's many times over.</p><h2>Mindsword&#39;s Story (6th Book of Lost Swords)</h2><p>Long ago, the gods forged Twelve Swords of Power and threw them on the gameboard of life for men to scramble over.

Around noon on a summer day a man alone was climbing toward this hidden place. He had begun climbing far below, and he was headed directly for the unseen hollow with fierce determination, as if he knew that it was there.<br>The climber was a strong and active man, though without any particular skill or experience in the art of ascending mountains; more than once today he had come near falling to his death when a handhold or foothold betrayed him. Dogged resolution had so far sustained him in his effort, though several times in the past two hours he had come near despairing of his survival.<br>The one fighting his way upward with such dedication was tall, dark of hair and beard, handsome in his own dark careless way. His age was approaching forty, and at the moment, breathing hard in the thin mountain air, he was keenly aware of every year.<br>The man's lean body had been worn leaner by much recent travel and other difficulties. He was dressed in the clothes of a soldier or a hunter; his jacket, much faded but still faintly blue and orange, might have been part of a uniform when it was new. He wore a small pack on his back; at the left side of his belt swung an empty sheath of a size to hold a long sword, balanced on the right side by a long practical knife. Despite the difficulties of the ascent, the climber evidently considered none of these items dispensable.<br>At the altitude where he had begun his long climb, the day was warm and sunny, but up here on the high slopes, somewhere around timberline, the summer afternoon was beginning with a light, cold drizzle, spiced with an occasional stinging pellet of snow or hail. Gusts of wind dragged rolling mists across the mountain's face, more often than not obscuring the climber's view of what lay ahead of him and above. Nevertheless he pressed on.<br>Already at many points in his ascent the climber had paused to rest. Now he did so once more, clinging in a brief truce to the nearly vertical rock. While catching his breath he examined his surroundings carefully, as if he expected to see something out of the ordinary. Also, he seemed to be listening intently, in hopes of picking up the sound of something more meaningful than wind.<br>Soon he advanced again, with unflagging determination.<br>His hopes, whatever their foundation, were soon justified, for presently he was granted evidence that his goal was near. As the climber's line of sight topped the next stony barrier he was able to see, no more than thirty meters above him and ahead, the notched entrance to a circular pit, which he knew must be the bottom of the hidden depression between crests.<br>At this sight the man paused, nodding to himself. Because of certain clues he had been given before he began to climb, he felt certain of what he was going to discover in that desolate place. And if any confirmation were needed that he was very near his goal, he had it now. Because now he was beginning to hear the voices.<br>The voices, which sounded more in his mind than in his ears, were strange to him, not just unfamiliar but extremely odd. In truth, as the explorer knew, they were not really vocal sounds. But he could not help hearing them and thinking of them as voices, these songs and cries that were so much more than the noise of the wet wind. There surged around him an utterance as of a multitude at worship, singing a polyphonic paean above the gusts.<br>The climber moved forward another step, and now a new sign appeared to assure him that he was on the right track, and had not far to go. The rocks ahead of him remained properly dead and motionless whenever he gazed straight at them. But all the landscape near the corners of his vision had now begun to move. The effect was such that the entire mountainside around him appeared to be on the verge of swirling away in an ecstatic dance.<br>Rendered momentarily dizzy by the illusion of dancing rocks, the seeker paused again, closing his eyes. The mountainside beneath his hands and feet felt stable, and with his intellect he knew it was. He understood perfectly well that the dance and the ecstasy were in his mind; but that rendered them no less rhythmic or ecstatic.<br>Having moved a little closer to his goal, the climber was able now to hear the magic voices more clearly, though still the words were indistinguishable. Some of the voices sounded human and some did not, but all of them were shrieking together in a great chorus of triumph and rapture.<br>The one who sought opened his eyes and studied the way ahead.<br>Although much of the mountainside was obscured by blowing mist, he knew that, physically, the worst of the climb was over. From where he stood, the surface he had still to negotiate angled more and more back toward the horizontal. Within the space of a few breaths the tall dark man, standing erect now and moving up on legs alone, was almost on the threshold of the notched entrance to the hollow in the rocks.<br>As he drew steadily nearer to that point, the fanciful--or perhaps not so fanciful--idea crossed the climber's mind that perhaps no other human being had set eyes upon these cracked and moss-grown stones since the old mountains had thrust upward from the earth.<br>Once more he felt himself rendered a touch unsteady by the superhuman power of magic that loomed ahead. Once more he paused to close his eyes, trying to regain an inner balance. Standing there with eyes closed and arms outstretched, the man thought that now he could <i>feel</i> the mountain dancing. It was as if the whole earth around him were acting out the joy of certain victory, of success extended to eternity...though what victory, or what success was being celebrated, was more than any mere mortal in his place could tell.<br>Opening his eyes, the adventurer found himself still groping like a blind man. Trying to make his mind a blank, he forced himself to forge on, one shuffling step after another.<br>And now at last he had reached the very threshold of the entrance to the secret place, a point from which he could see directly into the hollow before him.<br>Ahead, through swirling mist and wind, he beheld a broad cup of dark rock, irregular in shape, some forty meters across here at the sculpted bottom. The whole bottom of the cup was deeply littered by an age-old detritus of stones and rough soil eroded from the surrounding cliffs. Tough grass and other small plants, only enough of them to emphasize the barrenness, grew very sparsely in that soil.<br>In almost the precise middle of this desolate hollow, surmounting a natural cairn of tumbled stones, an upright Sword was poised.<br>The cruciform dull black hilt stood uppermost, over a long blade. The metal of that blade, straight as a ray of sun, and as naked as the surrounding rock, appeared unnaturally bright in the dull, cloud-filtered daylight. It flashed intermittently, sending forth momentary gleams as brilliant as the sun that hid itself above the wind-rushed clouds.<br>Considering the Sword's position, the discoverer surmised that it must at some time have fallen--or been cast--from somewhere high on one of the surrounding cliffs. The weapon had landed point first atop the rockpile, wedging itself indestructibly in some fine crevice, or perhaps cracking open its own niche with the force of its falling weight behind that unbreakable point.<br>But it was very hard to think, or plan. In the visitor's ears and through his mind, the voices that were not voices roared and sang unceasingly.<br>For a moment the tall man tilted back his head, the wind whipping his dark hair and beard, his eyes squinting up into the rolling, rushing clouds as if he hoped to be able to gather from them some sign, some trace, concerning the one who had discarded or accidentally dropped this god-forged weapon here.<br>How long might the Sword of Glory have been here, waiting to be claimed? The visitor could not be sure, but it might well have been for years. He could picture how in winter that bright Blade would stand here meters deep in drifted snow, and how in spring and summer it must be washed in floods of snowmelt and of rain. But not the smallest spot of rust showed on that steel; and the man who stood before it now would have been willing to wager his existence that this weapon had not lost the faintest increment of keenness from either of its long, finely tapered edges.<br>Possibly, he thought, the Blade had worn a sheath when it fell--or was hurled--into its present position. That it stood entirely naked now was easily explained--over a period of months or years, any covering of cloth or leather could have been nibbled away by the sharp teeth of scavengers, small mindless creatures unaffected by the magic they uncovered.<br>The absence of a covering, however, created certain problems for an approaching human being.<br>Hesitantly, advancing step by step with many pauses, the climber continued his progress toward the matchless treasure. As much as possible he kept his eyes averted from that gleaming Blade, and he tried without success to close his mind against the glare, the influence, that poured so boundlessly, like some effortless reflection of a melting sun, from the thing atop the mound of rock, the artifact that had been wrought at a god's forge from magic and meteoric metal.<br>The discoverer knew--but the knowledge was of little help--that the glare afflicting him was not really in his eyes. He reminded himself as he advanced--though the suggestion did him little good--that the roaring voices, those of beings forever balancing upon the brink of some orgasmic triumph, were not really in his ears.<br>Useless efforts to protect himself, useless. The finder knew an almost overpowering urge to fall on his knees and worship--not the Sword itself, no, but someone, some-thing, he knew not who or what, except that the object must be transcendent, and the Sword called him to it.<br>By now the man, gasping and trembling more in his excitement than from physical effort, was almost near enough to reach out and touch that dull black hilt. But some basic instinct of survival, justified or not, warned him that he must not do so yet.<br>When he dared to peer more closely at the hilt, he saw the small white symbol that he had known must be there, the device of a waving banner.<br>"It <i>is</i> the Mindsword, then," the trembling explorer whispered to himself. "It can be nothing else."--As if there could have been any doubt. But the mere sound of his own voice, which he could still manage to hold steady, his own words, which he could still contain within the bounds of rationality, helped him to master his excitement and his nameless fear.<br>He knew that many people, standing this close to this uncovered Blade, would have turned and fled in helpless terror. Many others would have fallen down in mindless worship of they knew not what. The discoverer, being a proud, able, and determined man, did neither. With tremendous stubbornness he had forced his way here, risking his life, to take possession of this prize. And he was not going to be deprived of it now.<br>But at the same time he feared that he might be unable to collect his treasure without help.<br>Yet again the adventurer squeezed shut his eyes, trying to establish some measure of composure. Closed lids shut out the sight of the Sword, but could not banish its majestic, insistent presence. In the depths of his mind and soul he could feel how the universe swirled around him. Half-born emotions only partially his own, fledgling hopes, stillborn ambitions, washed over him in a bewildering torrent. The man's brain echoed with the redoubled roar of a vast multitude of voices, some human and some not. All of them were praying, praising, worshiping--who? Or what?<br>He thought that it would prove impossible for him, strong man that he was, to remain for an hour within a hundred meters of this naked Blade when he did not control it. He had to possess his prize quickly, before it drove him mad or forced him into flight. And before he could touch it directly he had to cover it with something, muzzle its powers, put a sheath on it somehow.<br>The difficulty was not entirely unexpected; it was no accident that an empty sheath of the required size hung at the discoverer's belt. But he could not slip a sheath on the weapon in its present position, and he still dared not perform the simple act of reaching out to pluck the Mindsword from the rocks.<br>Surges of unidentifiable longing swept through the adventurer as he hesitated. He felt stabbed by pangs of deathly devotion to some overwhelmingly great but tantalizingly unspecific cause. Bright barbs that might have been sun-twinkles from the metal came dashing against his sanity like crests of poisoned foam.<br>Moving a half-step closer, he stretched out a hand toward the naked Sword--and then at the last moment dared not touch it.<br>Groaning, snatching back his trembling arm, the man fell back a step. And then another step, and yet another.<br>But this man was not going to give up. There might be another way. With unsteady fingers he began to unfasten the empty sheath from his Swordbelt.<br>With the detached sheath clutched in his left hand, the man gave a sound like a despairing giggle, and bent to pick up some small rocks. These he tossed, one after another, in the direction of the black hilt, trying to knock it over. At last one of his small missiles struck the Sword, which tilted but did not topple under the impact.<br>Laughing madly now, the man threw bigger stones, pitching them harder and harder, knowing that no rock he could ever throw, nothing he could ever do, could crack even the thinnest extremity of those sharpened edges.<br>At last he lobbed a larger stone that hit the Sword directly. The treasure fell, anticlimactically, making a slight noise. Obligingly its blade had now assumed a tilted position on the rockpile, the bright point uppermost, angled some degrees above the horizontal. And now the Sword's capturer could approach, sheath in hand, and--without needing to touch his prize directly--could begin to bind and tame his quarry, to hood it like a falcon with the mundane empty leather.<br>Slowly and carefully he got the point started into the sheath, then worked the sheath along the blade. In its new position the Mindsword rocked, slowly and precariously, with every indirect pressure from his hand.<br>The madness in the air, and in the rock, began to weaken.<br>The man could not have said how long the task occupied him, but eventually it was done. The simple covering was effective. The world was stable again, the many voices muted into-almost--perfect silence.<br>Now the latest possessor of the Mindsword could freely grasp the hard black pommel, feeling in it no more than the subtle power that any thing of great magic might be expected to possess, the sense of tremendous forces bound and coiled and waiting. Now he could pick up his great prize and buckle it on tightly at his belt. And now the world around him was perfectly worldly once again, consisting of little more than rocks and wind and rain.

Sexually, do you feel a shadow of your former self? </p><p>The problem, according to Ori Hofmekler, is that we have lost touch with the natural wisdom of our instinctual drives. We have become the slaves of our own creature comforts-scavenger/victims rather than predator/victors. When to comes to informed-choice, we lack any real sense of personal freedom. The result: ill-advised eating and lifestyle habits that leave us vulnerable to all manner of disease-not to mention obesity and sub-par performance. </p><p>The Warrior Diet presents a brilliant and far-reaching solution to our nutritional woes, based on a return to the primal power of our natural instincts. </p><p>The first step is to break the chains of our current eating habits. Drawing on a combination of ancient history and modern science, The Warrior Diet proves that humans are at their energetic, physical, mental and passionate best when they "undereat" during the day and "overeat" at night. Once you master this essential eating cycle, a new life of explosive vigor and vitality will be yours for the taking. </p><p>Unlike so many dietary gurus, Ori Hofmekler has personally followed his diet for over twenty-five years and is a perfect model of the Warrior Diet's success-the man is a human dynamo. </p><p>Not just a diet, but a whole way of life, the Warrior Diet encourages us to seize back the pleasures of being alive-from the most refined to the wild and raw. The Warrior Diet is practical, tested, and based in commonsense. Expect results! </p><p>The Warrior Diet covers all the bases. As an added bonus, discover delicious Warrior Recipes, a special Warrior Workout, and a line of Warrior Supplements-designed to give you every advantage in the transformation of your life from average to exceptional.</p></p><p>Ori Hofmekler is a modern Renaissance man whose life has been driven by two passions: art and sports. Hofmekler's formative experience as a young man with the Israeli Special Forces, prompted a lifetime's interest in diets and fitness regimes that would optimize his physical and mental performance. <p>After the army, Ori attended the Bezalel Academy of Art and the Hebrew University, where he studied art and philosophy and received a degree in Human Sciences. </p><p>A world-renowned painter, best known for his controversial political satire, Ori's work has been featured in magazines worldwide, including Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, People, The New Republic as well as Penthouse where he was a monthly columnist for 17 years and Health Editor from 1998-2000. Ori has published two books of political art, Hofmekler's People, and Hofmekler's Gallery. </p><p>As founder, Editor-In-Chief, and Publisher of Mind &amp; Muscle Power, a national men's health and fitness magazine, Ori introduced his Warrior Diet to the public in a monthly column-to immediate acclaim from readers and professionals in the health industry alike.</p><p>For the Greco-Roman soldier wannabe, this modified fasting program from a former member of the Israeli Special Forces is similar to weight builders' "animalbolics" diet. Forget calorie counting. Instead, Hofmekler suggests that we return to our bodies' instinctive eating style, "undereating" during the day and "overeating" at night. He recommends eating a daily main meal in the evening, with no caloric restrictions (light snacking on fresh fruits and vegetables is okay during the day, as is eating small amounts of lean protein). According to the author, this burns fat, builds muscles, accelerates metabolism, and slows aging. Short, intense strength and aerobic exercises (illustrated) are also part of the "warrior training," along with pre-and post-workout meals. Alluring though the "warrior" image may be, it seems unrealistic to expect most men especially the 40-plus who would most benefit to stick with this plan for a lifetime. </p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Modern Classics Prodigy</h2><p><i>The Prodigy</i>, originally dating from 1905, is Hermann Hesses's bitter indictment of conventional education. It is the story of Hans Giebenrath, the brilliant young son of provincial bourgeouis in southern Germany who becomes the first boy from his town to pass into a prestigious Protestant theological college. His spirit, however, is systematically broken by his parents and teachers; over anxious about his success, they forget to consider his health and happiness. Subsiding into a fatal apathy, he is taken home for medical reasons. Here he falls in love, becomes an engineer's apprentice, learns to drink alcohol, and eventually dies by drowning. Out of his attitude to the treatment that he perceived was common within the German schooling system at the turn of the century, Hesse developed his own deeply personal views on the value of Eastern education in developing the self.</p><p>Counted among the leading thinkers of the twentieth century, <b>HERMANN HESSE</b> was born in 1877. Rebelling against a stern monastic education, he worked as a locksmith and a bookseller before embarking on a 65-year writing career. Having travelled as far as India, he settled in Switzerland in 1911 in opposition to German militarism. Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1946, he died in 1963 aged eighty-five.<i>"A gentle and insidiously&nbsp;persuasive plea for the flight from academicism and the re-establishment of the simple values of the workman&#x2019;s life."</i>&nbsp; Sunday Times<br><br><i>"It is unusual for a writer to begin with sincerity alone and to advance to a more complex apprehension of life without surrendering his pristine innocence.

It shows the opportunity for bringing the world of man into equilibrium with the forces of his environment while there still remains time and maneuvering room. Man throughout history has focused on growth growth in population, standard of living, and geographical boundaries. But in the fixed space of the world, growth must in time give way to equilibrium. Malthus had postulated food supply as the ultimate limiting factor, but Professor Forrester suggests that pollution, crowding, and depletion of resources can play equally critical roles. Industrialization may be a more fundamental threat than population. Due to limitations of the environment, the entire world may not be able to rise to the standard of living that has been set as an example by the industrialized countries. Goals and aspirations of all countries must be drastically readjusted as growth and expansion give way to world equilibrium. The book is the first step towards adapting the principles of System Dynamics to the behavior of the forces involved in the transition from growth to world equilibrium. A stable enduring world equilibrium may require a combination of social, economic, and technical changes that include such counterintuitive policies as reducing the present emphasis on food production and industrialization Since its publication, the book has received world-wide notice and has catalyzed debate over the necessity of achieving world equilibrium. In this second edition, an additional chapter discusses the importance of social limits to growth.</p><p></p><h2>The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology</h2><p><p>This revisionary study offers a convincing new interpretation of Jeffersonian Republican thought in the 1790s.

His impressive study emphasizes that the final shape of America's stripling government was never a foregone conclusion but was hammered out link by link as Old World political models confronted New World ideologies."</p><br><br><p>"Banning supports his thesis with persuasive arguments, evidence, and a careful definition of the word 'ideology.'...

Original.</p><p>It isn't easy to be a female physician in 1894, but Leah Mundy is fiercely committed to healing her fellow humans. Being awakened in the dark of night to heal the sick is a common occurrence, but never before has she woke to a threatening gun barrel and a dangerous stranger demanding her services. Outlaw Jackson Underhill is grimly determined that the doctor will save his childhood friend, but nothing about his difficult and dark past has prepared him for the changes the beautiful doctor will bring to his life. When Leah manages to disable his sailboat and force him to bring his "wife" to her boarding home to be cared for, Jackson has no option but to comply, setting forces in motion that will change both of their lives forever.<p> Dr. Leah Mundy is a strong but emotionally vulnerable woman who has struggled her entire life to win the approval of her difficult, indifferent father. Now that he is dead, she is determined to build a life on Puget Sound's beautiful Whidbey Island. Accused of committing a murder he can't deny, outlaw Jackson Underhill is a man on the run, committed to saving his childhood friend while eluding the law. Leah is a woman who cannot leave the island that has become her sanctuary and Jackson Underhill is a man who cannot stay. Reason and logic tell them that they should never have fallen in love, but their hearts ignore all warnings. Inexorably drawn together by circumstance and fate, what possible resolution can bring them happiness and not disaster? Thrown together by chance, they find a love that neither of them had ever dared hope for - but darker forces and old alliances threaten their chance at happiness. With crisp, clean writing, Ms. Wiggs deftly weaves a seamless tale set against the background of the sea and sky of the Pacific Northwest. The beauty of Puget Sound pulses from every page, elevating the land and elements of nature to the level of a living character that is essential to the healing of Jackson and Leah's inner scars.

Numerous newspaper reports in the United States and abroad told of how the two -- fair-skinned Ellen disguised as a white slave master and William posing as her servant -- negotiated heart-pounding brushes with discovery while fleeing Macon, Georgia, for Philadelphia and eventually Boston. No account, though, conveyed the ingenuity, daring, good fortune, and love that characterized their flight for freedom better than the couple's own version, published in 1860, a remarkable authorial accomplishment only twelve years beyond illiteracy. Now their stirring first-person narrative and Richard Blackett's excellent interpretive pieces are brought together in one volume to tell the complete story of the Crafts.</p></p><p><p>Richard J. M.

In this installment, Secretary General (SecGen) Seafort must juggle the demands of a colonial empire across the stars, a powerfully politicized Navy, and a morally questionable world religious council against the needs of a dangerously degraded planet. Much of the book details Seafort's political maneuvering and the discarding of his anti-"Enviro" prejudices with the help of his idealistic son. But the action picks up before the book closes, as a crippled Seafort leads a small team to wrest a giant battleship from the hands of a mutinous captain unhappy with the SecGen's change of heart.<p> If you aren't already a fan of the "Seafort Saga," you may or may not be sold by <i>Patriarch's Hope</i>, depending on your tastes. The grizzled, conflicted Seafort huffs and puffs predictably throughout, and the pseudofuturistic, military motif is ever-present and a bit much at times (the "SecGen" and his "middies," use "puters," fly "helis," and find frequent cause to shout "Belay that!"). <i>Hope</i> is passable military SF, but it serves better as an adventure-filled primer on honor, stoicism, personal responsibility, and male bonding. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>David Fientuch is the award-winning author of the bestselling Seafort Saga: Midshipman&#39;s Hope, Challenger&#39;s Hope, Prisoner&#39;s Hope, Fisherman&#39;s Hope, and Voices of Hope, as well as The Still, called &#34;the best fantasy of the year&#34; by Science Fiction Chronicle.

Horowitz, using the voice of M16 covert weapons specialist Derek Smithers, details the gadgets he developed for 14-year-old spy Alex Rider during his first five adventures. For each device Smithers clarifies the setting in which the contrivance was used, offers a detailed description of its operation, and provides a labeled schematic diagram. The inventions, engineered with wonderful kid-appeal, include a high-tensile yo-yo, a radio mouth brace, and an exploding ear stud. Smithers emphasizes that none of the M16 gadgets are deadly (Alex is, after all, still a boy), although he also describes Scorpia's pizza delivery assassin kit and the CIA Geiger counter games console. Horowitz/Smithers' frequently tongue-in-cheek commentary will remind young readers that these gadgets are still the stuff of fiction, although an appended glossary of scientific and technical terms makes it clear that the contraptions aren't that far-fetched. A sure bet for Alex Rider's many fans; classes teaching technical writing may also find this an interesting model. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Searching through remote reaches of the Himalayas for traces of the creature, the author makes new discoveries and explanations and has more than a few adventures. He is not afraid to take risks, as is clear from his descriptions of one incident involving a life-threatening blizzard and another involving a smugglers' camp. The author weaves his own philosophy on the "wholeness of life" and the "interconnectedness between reality and nonphysical realities" into the descriptions of his explorations. His rich experience of doing things few of us would ever dream of (he divides his time among the U.S., India and Nepal) leads him to conclude that "The voyages we make, the farther we take them, the more complete is our understanding of the segment of existence that we are allowed to get to know, our life." The pace of the story is sometimes uneven, but the research is extensive and the anecdotes about life in the remote jungles and mountains of India and Nepal are fascinating. It's this combination of unusual natural history and Taylor-Ide's own life story makes the book more than just a chronicle of yeti searches.

To millions of Americans, Alexander Brass, newspaper columnist and radio personality, is the voice of Manhattan nightlife, and they rely on him for the latest gossip about the stars and the beautiful people, the gangsters and the lowlifes, who make up the scene. While researching his column at the latest hot spot, Alexander Brass learns that Two-Headed Mary, a renowned and beloved grifter who works the Broadway theaters, is missing and that her friends on the Street are worried. Brass runs a short item in his column about her disappearance and shortly thereafter he finds himself in the midst of a full-scale mystery. Not only does Mary's disappearance seem tied to the disappearance of an ex-chorus girl cum Broadway box-office ticket taker, but Brass learns that someone else out there is far too interested in Mary's whereabouts.</p></p><p>Michael Kurland&nbsp;has written almost forty books.&nbsp;He&nbsp;was the editor of&nbsp;the Sherlock Holmes collection <i>Sherlock Holmes: The Hidden Years</i>. Twice a finalist for the Edgar Award, he lives in Petaluma, California.Two-Headed Mary, the philanthropic panhandler who dresses like a society matron when she approaches theatergoers for donations to nonexistent charities, is missing. So is sidelined hoofer Billie Trask, who disappeared from the cashier's office of K. Jeffrey Welton's hit show Lucky Lady with the weekend take. Could either of them have followed a third Broadway babe, Fine and Dandy chorine Lydia Laurentwhose strangled, nude body, accompanied by two complete suits of clothing, has been found in Central Park? If this seems like an awful lot of women in jeopardy, Two-Headed Mary turns out to have enough separate identities to populate a small European monarchy: She's claimed under various guises by a Broadway hanger-on, a daughter, a husband, and a big-time con man, the Professor, who's got even more cover stories than she does. Since the police are as helpless as they always are in 1935, it falls to New York World columnist Alexander Brass and his cheerfully wide-eyed sidekick Morgan DeWitt to dig up the links between Two-Headed Mary and the blackmailer who's evidently trashed her apartment and taken her prisoner in between homicides. A smidgen better grounded than the equally effervescent Too Soon Dead (1997), though fans who don't share Kurland's nostalgia for an Olde New York of cocktails, cabaret singers, snappy repartee, and Damon Runyon zanies won't find much meat on these singing bones. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

One of the nightingales of the title is a gypsy bard who comes to Kingsford Faire and, before she leaves, is up to her eyebrows in intrigues both mundane and magical that involve a large cast of characters, not all of them human or even corporeal. The book displays Lackey's usual sound characterization, brisk pacing, and intelligently detailed world building, which will hold readers of both fantasy in general and Bardic Voices in particular. Lackey is sufficiently gifted that one continues to hope for work that is more original than what she has been producing lately. Still, she remains an undoubted mistress of the well-told tale, and if she does not dazzle, neither does she disappoint. <i>Roland Green</i>Nightingale and her friends are increasingly concerned about the Church's attitude toward non-human sentients that it doesn't control: her worries cause her to join forces with a birdman which turns into an unusual relationship as the two probe the ultimate influences behind the Church's decisions. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Gods Call</h2><p>In the tradition of God&#39;s Smuggler, God&#39;s Call recounts Brother Andrew&#39;s dramatic meetings with world leaders and clandestine encounters with persecuted Christians in communist China, turbulent Africa, and repressive Muslim nations.

But when Representative Lyle Canton, House Majority Whip, is found shot dead in his office in the U.S. Capitol and DeMarco is arrested for the murder, DeMarco knows he&#x2019;s been framed. Locked up in the Alexandria Jail awaiting trial, he calls on his enigmatic friend Emma, an ex-DIA agent, to search for the true killer.<br>Emma&#x2019;s investigation leads her to Sebastian Spear, the ruthless and competitive CEO of the multi-billion-dollar Spear Industries. Spear had a motive for killing Lyle Canton: Canton&#x2019;s wife, Jean, had once been Spear&#x2019;s high school sweetheart and the one true love of his life&#x2015;until Canton won her over. Now Jean was dead, killed in a car crash while driving drunk, and Spear blamed Canton for the accident. But the case the F.B.I. has built against DeMarco is airtight, and not a single piece of evidence points to the grieving CEO. Using her cunning and her D.C. connections, Emma sets out to prove that Spear has been using some fixers of his own.<br>Featuring crimes of passion, corporate corruption, and partisan feuds, <i>House Arrest</i> is a gripping, timely political thriller, and one of Lawson&#x2019;s best books yet.</p><p><b>Mike Lawson</b> is a former senior civilian executive for the US Navy. He is the author of twelve previous novels starring Joe DeMarco and three novels with his protagonist Kay Hamilton.As Emma had no answer to Agent Peyton&#x2019;s question, she asked a question of her own: &#x201c;Agent Peyton, have you considered the possibility that someone may be trying to frame DeMarco for Canton&#x2019;s murder?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know, John Mahoney said the same thing and I&#x2019;ll tell you what I told him. In my twenty-five years in the Bureau, I&#x2019;ve never heard of a single person being framed for a crime.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, how would you have heard?&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;If the frame was perfect an innocent man would be sent to jail and no one would ever know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, but I&#x2019;ve never even heard of a botched frame. Nor can I remember a defense attorney ever making a plausible argument in court that a client was framed. Mistaken identity, yes. Framed, no. People are framed in movies.&#x201d;<br>When Emma didn&#x2019;t immediately respond, Peyton said, &#x201c;Let me ask you something, Emma. If a smart, rich person like you wanted someone dead, why would you do something as complicated as framing someone for the murder? Killing the guy yourself in some clever way would be simpler. Or if you couldn&#x2019;t do it yourself, why not just hire a sniper to shoot the guy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you why,&#x201d; Emma said, &#x201c;and the reason is you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Peyton said.<br>&#x201c;Yes. If the person I wanted to kill was a U.S. congressman I would know that the FBI would assign a man like you to the case, along with a hundred other agents, and you wouldn&#x2019;t give up until you caught me. But if I framed someone and if you caught the person I framed immediately&#x2015;which you did in the case of DeMarco&#x2015;then I might get away with the murder because you&#x2019;d no longer be hunting for me.&#x201d;</p><h2>I Hope You Dance Journal</h2><p><p>Both as a hit song and as a <i>New York Times</i> best selling book, <i>IHope You Dance</i> has captured the hearts of people the world over.

Penetrating in its analysis and insight, savage in its wit, <b>Up From Conservatism</b> adds an important and funny voice to the '96 campaign.For nearly a decade, Michael Lind worked closely as a writer and editor with the intellectual leaders of American conservatism. Slowly, he came to believe that the many prominent intellectuals he worked with were not the leaders of the conservative movement but the followers and apologists for an increasingly divisive and reactionary political strategy orchestrated by the Republican party. Lind's disillusionment led to a very public break with his former colleagues on the right, as he attacked the Reverend Pat Robertson for using anti-Semitic sources in his writings.<p>In <i>Up From Conservatism</i>, this former rising star of the right reveals what he believes to be the disturbing truth about the hidden economic agenda of the conservative elite. The Republican capture of the U.S. Congress in 1994 did not represent the conversion of the American public to conservative ideology. Rather, it marked the success of the thirty-year-old "southern strategy" begun by Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon. From the Civil War to the civil rights revolution, the southern elite combined a low-wage, low-tax strategy for economic development with a politics of demagogy based on race-baiting and Bible-thumping. Now, Lind maintains, the economic elite that controls the Republican party is following a similar strategy on a national scale, using their power to shift the tax burden from the rich to the middle class while redistributing wealth upward.</p><p>To divert attention from their favoritism toward the rich, conservatives play up the "culture war," channeling popular anger about falling real wages and living standards away from Wall Street and focusing it instead on the black poor and nonwhite immigrants.</p><p>The United States, Lind concludes, could use a genuine "one-nation" conservatism that seeks to promote the interests of the middle class and the poor as well as the rich. But today's elitist conservatism poses a clear and present danger to the American middle class and the American republic.</p></p><h2>Murder to Music: Musical Mysteries from Ellery Queen&#39;s Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine</h2><p>Gathers short mysteries by Agatha Christie, Cornell Woolrich, George Baxt, and Lillian de la Torre</p><p>Cynthia Manson is the editor of Murder by the Book, Death on the Verandah and Women of Mystery I and II, among other titles. Kathleen Halligan is the co-editor of Murder Intercontinental.As even the perfect Wagnerite knows, it's not easy to tell a compelling story while providing great music, and atmosphere prevails over mystery-mongering in most of these 15 stories (194793) chosen by Manson and Halligan (Murder Intercontinental, 1996). Six involve the opera, but except for James Yaffe's sprightly armchair matriarch (``Mom Sings an Aria''), the stories are more successful when they get down and dirty (Doug Allyn's ``The Sultans of Soul'' and John Lutz's ``The Right to Sing the Blues'') or hit the road (Lynne Barrett's droll trio of Elvis impersonators). For sheer ingenuity, Lillian de la Torre's ``The Viotti Stradivarius,'' a Dr. Sam Johnson adventure from 1950 (1783, says Boswell) wins in a walk. The supporting cast--Agatha Christie, Linda Haldeman, Seymour Shubin, Cornell Woolrich, L.A. Taylor, George Baxt, Michael Underwood, Edward D. Hoch, Charlotte Hinger, William Bankier--provides a whole spectrum of emotional highs and lows, but no other standouts. Unlike a recording of opera excerpts, this collection doesn't provide enough highlights from artists who've mostly done their far better work elsewhere. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this extensively illustrated book Sydney Anglo, a leading historian of the Renaissance and its symbolism, provides the first complete study of the martial arts from the late fifteenth to the late seventeenth century. He explains the significance of martial arts in Renaissance education and everyday life and offers a full account of the social implications of one-to-one combat training.<br><br>Like the martial arts of Eastern societies, ritualized combat in the West was linked to contemporary social and scientific concerns, Anglo shows. During the Renaissance, physical exercise was regarded as central to the education of knights and gentlemen. Soldiers wielded a variety of weapons on the battlefield, and it was normal for civilians to carry swords and know how to use them. In schools across the continent, professional masters-of-arms taught the skills necessary to survive in a society where violence was endemic and life cheap. Anglo draws on a wealth of evidence&#x2015;from detailed treatises and sketches by jobbing artists to magnificent images by D�rer and Cranach and descriptions of real combat, weapons and armor&#x2015;to reconstruct and illustrate the arts taught by these ancient masters-at-arms.<br></p><p><b>Sydney Anglo</b> is research professor of history at the University of Wales.<br>"Fascinating." -- <i>Globe and Mail</i></p><h2>Legends of the Earth;: Their Geologic Origins</h2><p>1973, hardcover edition, Indiana University Press, Bloomigton, IN. 305 pages.

In 1946 he, his wife, and three children abandoned a plan to move to Haiti to escape racial prejudice in the United States. Instead, they made the improbable decision to purchase a home in tiny Westford, Vermont, twenty miles northeast of Burlington. At the time, the Thomases were the only non-white members of the community. The Seeking is the grim account of the Thomases&#x2019; lives before Vermont, their decision to give living in America one last chance, and the moving, heartfelt, uplifting story of their time among the people of Westford&#x2014;a life, writes Thomas, &#x201c;not based on race, but on what we and they [were] like as human beings.&#x201d;Back in print for the first time in fifty years, this edition includes a new introduction that situates The Seeking in the canon of twentieth-century black literature, and a new afterword that follows the fortunes of Thomas and his family in the years after its initial publication. With appearances by the author&#x2019;s notable friends, including the novelist Chester Himes and sociologist Horace Cayton, Jr., The Seeking is both a story of one remarkable African-American family and a story of New England race relations in the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p>WILL THOMAS (pseudonym of William Smith, 1900&#x2013;1970) was the author of the novel God Is for White Folks, published in 1947.

Focusing on his wives, lovers, and female friends, Bernice Kert highlights aspects of the writer's personality that are often shrouded by his hypermasculine public image. Women were certainly attracted by Hemingway's swaggering charm and boundless vitality, but they also discerned an underlying strain of sensitivity and vulnerability he concealed from the world. Although a friend once remarked that Hemingway was the only man he knew who really hated his mother, Kert's stereotype-shattering depiction of their combative relationship limns Grace Hall Hemingway in more nuanced terms than her son ever did and reminds readers that much of Hemingway's creativity and competitiveness came from her. The wives emerge as people in their own right, though journalist Martha Gelhorn was the only one to find her career more interesting than being Mrs. Hemingway. Kert's portraits of the unwitting models for the author's heroines reveal significant differences between the actual Agnes von Kurowsky and the fictional Catherine Barkley in <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, between Duff Twysden and Brett Ashley in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. Hemingway tended to write about the ideal female; Kert restores the real women who shaped his life and art. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>&#x201c;Absorbing. . . .

Slavoj Zizek</p><br><br>'In his clearly argued essay, now available in an excellent English translation, the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux shows that subjectivity and objectivity must be conceived of independently of each other ...

The book is exceptionally clear and concise, entirely devoted to a single chain of reasoning. It combines a confident insitence on the self-sufficiency of rational demonstration with an equally rationalist suspicion of mere experience and consensus....[this] is a beautifully written and seductively argued book." - Peter Hallward, <em>Radical Philosophy</em>, 2008<br><br>"<em>After Finitude</em> will certainly play a central role in ongoing debates on the status of philosophy, on questions pertaining to epistemology and, above all, to ontology. It will not only be an unavoidable point of reference for those working on the question of finitude, but also for those whose work deals with political theology, and the status of the religious turn of philosophy. After <em>Finitude</em> will certainly become an ideal corrosive against too rigid assumptions and will shake entrenched positions." &#x2014; Gabriel Riera, University of Illinois, Chicago, in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, 2008<br><br>"There is something absolutely exhilarating about Meillassoux's argument, and it is not difficult to see why his book has already aroused so much interest. The exposition and critique of correlationism is brilliant and Meillassoux is at his best when showing the philosophical complacency of contemporary Kantians and phenomenologists. The proposal of speculative realism is audacious and bracing, particularly when he defends the idea of nature as a 'glacial universe', cold and indeifferent to humans. Such is Pascal's 'Eternal silence of infinite spaces', but without the consolation of a wager of God's existence. However, by Mellassoux's own admission, his proposal is incomplete and we await its elaboration in future books. Although, his style of presentation can turn into a sort of fine-grained logic-chopping worthy of Duns Scotus, the rigour, clarity and passion of the argument can be breathtaking." &#x2014; Simon Critchley, TLS, Feb 2009<br><br><p>"Meillassoux addresses the question whether natural laws are necessary, and if so why, raised by Kant and gnawed by subsequent philosophers from Hume to Foucault. He offers a logical proof that the only feature of the laws of nature that is absolutely necessary is that they are contingent. He explores the ethical and metaphysical implications.

One stunning twist. Meet Jake, a studious freshman weighing how far to go to find a brotherhood that will introduce him to lifelong friends and help conquer his social awkwardness; and Oliver, a hardworking chapter president trying to keep his misunderstood fraternity out of trouble despite multiple run-ins with the police.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their year-in-the-life stories help explain why students are joining fraternities in record numbers despite scandalous headlines. To find out what it&#x2019;s like to be a fraternity brother in the twenty-first century, Robbins contacted hundreds of brothers whose chapters don&#x2019;t make headlines&#x2014;and who suggested that many fraternities can be healthy safe spaces for men.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Fraternity&nbsp;</i>is more than just a page-turning, character-driven read. It&#x2019;s a vital book about the transition from boyhood to manhood; it brilliantly weaves psychology, current events, neuroscience, and interviews to explore the state of masculinity today, and what that means for students and their parents. It&#x2019;s a different kind of story about college boys, a story in which they candidly discuss sex, friendship, social media, drinking, peer pressure, gender roles, and even porn. And it&#x2019;s a book about boys at a vulnerable age, living on their own for perhaps the first time. Boys who, in a climate that can stigmatize them merely for being male, don&#x2019;t necessarily want to navigate the complicated, coming-of-age journey to manhood alone.</p><p><b>Alexandra Robbins&nbsp;</b>is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

Jake had carefully timed his arrival: 11:00 p.m., not so early as to appear eager but not so late as to miss peak capacity. He was glad he had come with the three freshmen he knew from high school. Once they had walked through the double-arched white Gothic gates that flanked the campus entrance, and past a few bars and a gas station, the town became sketchy. Jake didn't know whether to be intimidated or comforted by the hordes of students streaming from various directions in groups of 10, 20, even 30. His first-ever fraternity party was going to be a memorable one.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Jake's group reached the front of the line at the Delta Rho house, two fraternity brothers manning the backyard gate let the girls right in. Jake and his good friend Arjun tried to follow them, but a brother held up a hand. "Girls can stay but guys have to pay," he said.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's terrible, Jake thought. Arjun and Jake each pulled out the five dollars they saw the older guys in front of them pay. That's so arbitrary. It's a party! Why should gender matter?<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the guys attempted to hand over their money, the brother stopped them again. "Guys pay ten dollars now." No one's questioning how messed up this is, Jake thought as he gave the brother another five. Why do guys have to pay more the later the party goes? The long line of students fidgeted behind him. Jake hurried through the gate without protest.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Jake was packed elbow to elbow with hundreds of students gathered among the three bars set up around the yard. Most people seemed to be drinking Delta Rho's signature jungle juice, a strong, unidentifiable concoction. In a corner, a DJ spun loud dance music. The air, sweltering thanks to body heat and the August humidity, reeked of alcohol and weed. Standing next to Arjun, who was already on his third drink, Jake quietly surveyed the scene, holding a red Solo cup from which he planned to take one sip every half hour for appearance's sake.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In high school, Jake and Arjun had been straight-A students who were heavily involved in school activities and did not party. The two girls from their competitive high school who had also been accepted to the selective Town College (TC) were similarly inclined. All four of them had sat at the same cafeteria table, where they usually did their AP homework or played trivia games. On Friday nights, if they went out, they saw a movie or chilled at someone's house. On Saturday nights, Jake usually stayed home with his family. He was known in high school both for being the class overachiever and for his long blond sideburns. Classmates liked to joke that, at five foot eight, with wire-rimmed glasses and a smile that seemed to light up half his face, Jake resembled a bespectacled teenage Calvin without a Hobbes.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arjun came from a staid Pakistani family that prioritized academics and shunned alcohol. When he had moved into his dorm last week, his parents asked Jake, whom they knew was not a drinker, to watch over their son. Unsure whether they were kidding, Jake had so far tried his best.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But how do you police friends who do not want to be policed? Already, Jake could sense the dynamics changing among his high school friends. Last week, his classmates had partied out of control. Arjun specifically had become almost a burden, drinking to excess until he transformed into someone whom Jake thought embodied "the stereotype of a frat bro." Jake would walk him home, even when Arjun didn't want to go, half-carrying him for blocks.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Woo! Party! WOO!" Arjun yelled now, to no one.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A gorgeous girl approached Jake and Arjun. "Hi! I'm an Epsilon sister and the girlfriend of the Delta Rho president," she said. "So are you guys interested in Greek life?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jake nodded.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hell yes!" Arjun said. He was dead set on rushing, lured by the hookup to parties, drinks, and girls.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Which fraternities are you interested in rushing?" she prodded.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Uh, I don't know if I want to talk about what fraternities I'm interested in while I'm at a Delta Rho party," Jake half-joked. He hadn't expected to have this conversation so early in the semester.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She waved him off. "Oh, no. It's fine."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yo, def D-Rho," Arjun said, and listed a few other fraternities. Jake's eyes widened. Arjun had named only top-tier fraternities. Jake didn't have the heart to tell him he'd heard that top-tiers at TC rarely gave bids to minorities.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On many campuses across the country, students unofficially ranked fraternities and sororities, labeling them as top-tier, middle-tier, or bottom-tier chapters. Jake knew this because, like everything else in his life, he had researched it extensively. He had spent hours over the summer poring over message boards about TC fraternities, taking copious notes, as if familiarizing himself with campus Greek life were his first and potentially most important college homework assignment.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sorority girl turned to Jake. "And you?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have a few ideas. Kappa Tau, and this party's got me interested in rushing Delta Rho," he lied, to be polite. Jake was too intimidated to rush Delta Rho, or any other top-tier fraternity, because he wasn't, as he put it, "a party-hard, sports-playing dude who's like a total bro all the time." He planned to aim for middle-tier fraternities because he assumed they weren't as intense or competitive as the top-tier groups, he'd be less likely to get hazed, and he'd have better opportunities to meet kindred spirits.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He didn't tell the sorority sister why he was rushing K-Tau-or why a guy like him, who didn't consider himself "the fraternity type," wanted to go Greek to begin with. Jake's father, a former K-Tau chapter officer, had told him fraternity tales for years. He was over-the-moon excited for his son to be a part of his fraternity so they could share the secrets, that legacy, those stories. Jake was already close with his parents and his two younger sisters; he'd been surprised that he didn't cry when they said goodbye after moving him into his dorm. For Jake, the prospect of becoming even closer to his father through their shared K-Tau membership was irresistible.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If not for his dad, Jake might not have chosen to rush. He was scared of hazing. No matter whom he asked about which fraternities hazed and what kind of hazing they did, he couldn't get a straight answer. ("It's apparently a well-kept secret," he told me.) The idea of forced drinking terrified him. He had never been drunk before, didn't like the taste of alcohol or the way it made him feel, and didn't want to lose control of himself. He couldn't begin to fathom how he would handle being forced to do something against his will or to participate in activities that would make him uncomfortable.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Jake's father, who wasn't a stereotypical frat bro either, believed Jake could benefit immensely from the lessons and friendships that fraternities had to offer. He often said that his time in K-Tau was his most valuable college experience. At TC's prerecruitment meeting, Jake was reassured by the Interfraternity Council's statement that hazing was not a part of TC's Greek community. At TC, as at most schools, the IFC governed the predominantly white social fraternities. (Service, honors, professional, and religious fraternities are separate organizations.) IFC officers assured the TC recruits that they could choose how much time to spend with their chapter. It was like another class, they said, but a casual one. And much of that time, the IFC insisted, was spent on study hours and tutoring opportunities.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jake liked the IFC officers' description of campus Greek life. Fraternity brothers had higher GPAs than non-Greeks, controlled the student government and some other major campus groups, were responsible for most of the college's charitable funding, and, as the officers kept hammering home, developed students into "better people." Jake had three goals for college: Get good grades, get involved in activities, and meet a variety of new people. A fraternity seemed like a great way to accomplish all three at once.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even more, Jake craved the bonds of a brotherhood. For him, "the biggest allure of an all-male group is the idea that you have guys you could depend on for whatever, to be part of a solid group of people you can relate to and keep in close touch with." He wanted to feel that there was somewhere he belonged.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jake also hoped that joining a fraternity would improve his social confidence. He called himself "the textbook definition of an introvert," prone to "awkward conversations and cringe-worthy displays of social anxiety." He winced when he thought about his first-ever college social event. It was his second day on campus, before his high school friends had moved in and before he had met anyone at TC. (He had arrived early to give himself time to get acclimated and to claim the lower bunk in his dorm room.) A dorm on Central Campus was holding a pizza party open to all freshmen. Figuring he had to eat anyway, Jake psyched himself up for the chance to meet people and score some free food.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because the dorm was farther across campus than he'd anticipated, he was 20 minutes late. Fifty students were already there, chatting in small circles. Jake took a slice of pizza and awkwardly stood alone in a space between groups, munching quietly while dozens of unfamiliar people mingled and laughed. For a while, afraid to make eye contact, he stared down at his phone, pretending to look preoccupied.<br><br> Then he mustered the courage to attempt to join a group in mid-conversation. Hesitant to interrupt, he didn't introduce himself. The students were gossiping about mutual friends and last night's parties. Jake didn't volunteer his Saturday night activities, which had consisted of calling his parents and messing around online. He ended up uneasily listening to the group and occasionally laughing along with everyone else, until he understood that their odd glances at him signaled that he couldn't possibly get their inside jokes because he turned out to be the only person at the party who didn't live in that dorm. Somehow this level of social awkwardness was not unusual for Jake. He had made similar gaffes between then and tonight's Delta Rho party.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the yard at Delta Rho, Jake was nervously chatting with Arjun when, without warning, the music stopped and the lights went out, leaving little visible save a third-story window of the house. Three brothers climbed out the window, shimmied onto the roof, and posed. "ARE YOU READY TO PARTY!" they yelled. The crowd erupted.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The brothers shot firecrackers into the air, raining ash and soot on many of the partygoers, who mostly seemed too wasted to care. Whoa, whoa, what's happening?! Jake thought, starting to panic. He didn't think the firecrackers had hit anyone, but he wasn't positive. A brother on the roof shook a champagne bottle, popped the cork, and poured champagne onto the students below. The crowd cheered again, the music resumed, the lights flicked back on, and the party raged even harder than before.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, college is going to be interesting, Jake thought. What am I getting myself into?<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An hour and a half later, he dragged a resistant Arjun out of the party. After downing five cups of jungle juice and who knew how many shots, Arjun was mumbling and could barely stand.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't wanna leave," he muttered. "Party!"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay, Arjun. All right. Time to go, man, time to go," Jake said.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few blocks away, Arjun veered toward a bush and puked. Unfazed by the disgusted reactions of student onlookers, Arjun rallied, raising his arms in a victory sign. "PARTY!" he shouted, delighted. A minute later, he retched into another bush, then continued walking, beaming beatifically at everyone who passed by.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh man, you're not going to like this in the morning," Jake told him.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arjun stopped short at a lamppost, happy as could be. "Yo, man, I'm gonna climb this pole. Watch me!" Unaware that he hadn't left the ground, he humped the lamppost.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next night, Jake again tried to party with his high school friends. Arjun again drank until he barfed. One of the girls drank herself out of her mind; she continually told anyone within earshot that she was ugly, and then tried to make out with the first guy other than Jake to disagree with her. "My friends have already changed since coming to college. These aren't the same people I knew," Jake told me later. "I'm not having a good time at these parties because I have to watch over these guys, and they're making no sense. I'm trying to meet new people, but I feel lonely because I'm the most sober person in the group."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He yearned for real friends more than ever, for confidants who viewed friendship as a two-way street, who would make this new, bewildering stage of schooling feel more like he was on a grand adventure with buddies than like he was peering forlornly through a window into a club full of people who knew better than he did how to have fun, how to be cool, and how to fit in.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jake was, he now knew for sure, ready for fraternity rush.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Introduction: A Different Kind of Story<br><br></p><p>About Boys in College<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's a tough time to be a college-bound teenage boy. Surviving an increasingly competitive high school environment is hard enough; today's young men are doing it during what has been called "a collapse in the American construction of masculinity." Unsure about what's expected of them, they're growing up in a world where women can be doctors, but men still face stigma for becoming nurses; where the majority of high school dropouts are male; and where experts point to "toxic masculinity" as a driving force behind everything from mass shootings to international terrorism.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With their support networks often reduced to the size, and depth, of a smartphone, boys may need some sort of "fraternity" more than ever. According to an American College Health Association survey of 28,000 college students, more than 50 percent of college guys "felt very lonely" in the last 12 months and more than 20 percent in the last two weeks. It's not always easy for boys to make friends. Worse, those who don't find the socialization and connections they yearn for could face dire consequences: Boys comprise 75 percent of 15- to 19-year-olds who commit suicide.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Greek-letter fraternities have long promised b...</p></p><h2>Oral Tradition in Ancient Israel (Biblical Performance Criticism)</h2><p>Providing a comprehensive study of &#34;oral tradition&#34; in Israel, this volume unpacks the nature of oral tradition, the form it would have taken in ancient Israel, and the remains of it in the narrative books of the Hebrew Bible. The author presents cases of oral/written interaction that provide the best ethnographic analogies for ancient Israel and insights from these suggest a model of transmission in oral-written societies valid for ancient Israel. Miller reconstructs what ancient Israelite oral literature would have been and considers criteria for identifying orally derived material in the narrative books of the Old Testament, marking several passages as highly probable oral derivations. Using ethnographic data and ancient Near Eastern examples, he proposes performance settings for this material. The epilogue treats the contentious topic of historicity and shows that orally derived texts are not more historically reliable than other texts in the Bible.</p><p></p><h2>Neither Here Nor There</h2><p>"Not long after I moved with my family to a small town in New Hampshire, I happened upon a path that vanished into a wood on the edge of town."<br><br>So begins Bill Bryson's hilarious book <i>A Walk in the Woods.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Following his return to America after twenty years in Britain, Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The AT, as it's affectionately known to thousands of hikers, offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes--and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to test his own powers of ineptitude, and to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>For a start, there's the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa who accompanies the similarly unfit Bryson on the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Bryson and Katz settle into their stride, it's not long before they come across the fabulously annoying Mary Ellen, whose disappearance ruins a perfectly good slice of pie, a gang of Ralph Lauren-attired yuppies from whom Katz appropriates a key piece of equipment, and a security guard in Pennsylvania who, for no ascertainable reason, impounds Bryson's car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mile by arduous mile these latter-day pioneers walk America, along the way surviving the threat of bear attacks, the loss of key provisions, and everything else this awe-inspiring country can throw at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this fragile and beautiful trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp;An adventure, a comedy, a lament, and a celebration, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is destined to become a modern classic of travel literature.</p><p>Bill Bryson was born in Des Moines, Iowa.&nbsp;&nbsp;For twenty years he lived in England, where he worked for <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Independent,</i> and wrote for many major British and American publications.&nbsp;&nbsp;His books include the travel memoirs <i>Neither Here nor There, The Lost Continent,</i> and <i>Notes from a Small Island,</i> as well as <i>The Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;He now lives in Hanover, New Hampshire, with his wife and four children.<b>Chapter One<br><br>To the North</b><br><br>In winter, Hammerfest is a thirty-hour ride by bus from Oslo, though why anyone would want to go there in winter is a question worth considering. It is on the edge of the world, the northernmost town in Europe, as far from London as London is from Tunis, a place of dark and brutal winters, where the sun sinks into the Arctic Ocean in November and does not rise again for ten weeks.<br><br>I wanted to see the Northern Lights. Also, I had long harbored a half-formed urge to experience what life was like in such a remote and forbidding place. Sitting at home in England with a glass of whiskey and a book of maps, this had seemed a capital idea. But now as I picked my way through the gray late December slush of Oslo, I was beginning to have my doubts.<br><br>Things had not started well. I had overslept at the hotel, missing breakfast, and had to leap into my clothes. I couldn't find a cab and had to drag my ludicrously overweight bag eight blocks through slush to the central bus station. I had had huge difficulty persuading the staff at the Kreditkassen Bank on Karl Johansgate to cash sufficient travelers' checks to pay the extortionate 1,200-kroner bus fare &#x2014; they simply could not be made to grasp that the William McGuire Bryson on my passport and the Bill Bryson on my travelers' checks were both me &#x2014; and now here I was arriving at the station two minutes before departure, breathless and steaming from the endless uphill exertion that is my life, and the girl at the ticket counter was telling me that she had no record of my reservation.<br><br>"This isn't happening," I said. "I'm still at home in England enjoying Christmas. Pass me a drop more port, will you, darling?" Actually, I said: "There must be some mistake. Please look again."<br><br>The girl studied the passenger manifest. "No, Mr. Bryson, your name is not here."<br><br>But I could see it, even upside down. "There it is, second from the bottom."<br><br>"No," the girl decided, "that says Bernt Bj�rnson. That's a Norwegian name."<br><br>"It doesn't say Bernt Bj�rnson. It says Bill Bryson. Look at the loop of the y, the two l's. Miss, please."<br><br>But she wouldn't have it.<br><br>"If I miss this bus when does the next one go?"<br><br>"Next week at the same time."<br><br>Oh, splendid.<br><br>"Miss, believe me, it says Bill Bryson."<br><br>"No, it doesn't."<br><br>"Miss, look, I've come from England. I'm carrying some medicine that could save a child's life." She didn't buy this. "I want to see the manager."<br><br>"He's in Stavanger."<br><br>"Listen, I made a reservation by telephone. If I don't get on this bus I am going to write a letter to your manager that will cast a shadow over your career prospects for the rest of this century." This clearly did not alarm her. Then it occurred to me. "If this Bernt Bj�rnson doesn't show up, can I have his seat?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>Why don't I think of these things in the first place and save myself the anguish? "Thank you," I said and lugged my bag outside.<br><br>The bus was a large double-decker, like an American Greyhound, but only the front half of the upstairs had seats and windows. The rest was solid aluminum covered with a worryingly psychedelic painting of an intergalactic landscape, like the cover of a pulp science fiction novel, with the words "Express 2000" emblazoned across the tail of a comet. For one giddy moment I thought the windowless back end might contain a kind of dormitory and that at bedtime we would be escorted back there by a stewardess who would invite us to choose a couchette. I was prepared to pay any amount of money for this option. But I was mistaken. The back end, and all the space below us, was for freight. "Express 2000" was really just a long-distance truck with passengers.<br><br>We left at exactly noon. I quickly realized that everything about the bus was designed for discomfort. I was sitting beside the heater, so that while chill drafts teased by upper extremities, my left leg grew so hot that I could hear the hairs on it crackle. The seats were designed by a dwarf seeking revenge on full-sized people; there was no other explanation. The young man in front of me had put his seat so far back that his head was all but in my lap. He had the sort of face that makes you realize God does have a sense of humor and he was reading a comic book called Tommy og Tigern. My own seat was raked at a peculiar angle that induced immediate and lasting neckache. It had a lever on its side, which I supposed might bring it back to a more comfortable position, but I knew from long experience that if I touched it even tentatively the seat would fly back and crush both the kneecaps of the sweet little old lady sitting behind me, so I left it alone. The woman beside me, who was obviously a veteran of these polar campaigns, unloaded quantities of magazines, tissues, throat lozenges, ointments, unguents, and fruit pastilles into the seat pocket in front of her, then settled beneath a blanket and slept more or less continuously through the whole trip.<br><br>We bounced through a snowy half-light, out through the sprawling suburbs of Oslo and into the countryside. The scattered villages and farmhouses looked trim and prosperous in the endless dusk. Every house had Christmas lights burning cheerily in the windows. I quickly settled into that not unpleasant state of mindlessness that tends to overcome me on long journeys, my head lolling on my shoulders in the manner of someone who has lost all control of his neck muscles...<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The French GI Diet: 100 Low Carb Recipes</h2><p>Over 20 years ago, Michel Montignac which among the roofridge nutritionists ton introduce the glycemic index as a weight loss concept.

College student David Rain's new professor, Dr. Bergstrom, a polar research scientist, introduces him to legends from the Arctic and invites him to write an essay about dragons to qualify for a research trip. A succession of paranormal events leads to David's flamboyant classmate Zanna inadvertently quickening a dragon egg belonging to his landlady, Liz. A powerful woman who calls herself Gwyneth, and who claims to be Liz's aunt, arrives to help with the arrival of the new dragon. David discovers that Gwyneth is a figure from dragon legends, and that her motivations may lead to harm for him and for his friends. His attempts to oppose her result in an action-packed conclusion, expanding further on the legends and leaving room for the final volume in the series. In contrast to the domestic story of <i>The Fire Within</i>, <i>Icefire</i> offers a darker and more mature story. Liz's clay dragons develop a greater degree of realism within the story, and their background is further explored. Readers will find action and mysteries aplenty in this fantastic tale, as well as a group of appealing dragons who are tricky, heroic, and often charming.<i>&#x2013;Beth L.

She takes you into the world of narcissism, addiction (pornography), divorce, and the negative traumatic experiences it has had on her and her family. Not only does she take you on the journey of emotional abuse but she writes about it while struggling with complex post-traumatic stress disorder. In the book, you get a bird's-eye view of how the brain functions as she sifts and works through the healing process while processing all the emotional pain that was inflicted on her. </p> <p>Haley gives a poignant look at a life of abuse that goes undetected by society because the abuse is well camouflaged within the family unit. She explains the negative effects that narcissism, coupled with pornography, has on children, even adult children. Because of the research Haley has done, along with her experiences, she can relate to those who are dealing with loved ones who have personality disorders and addictions, those who are being personally managed down, and those who are experiencing the loss of identity ending in divorce. She tells of slowly regaining her life temporarily lost and finding hope to live again in a broken world. Haley is determined that this need not be the end of the story; rather, it is a beginning.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Willows in Winter (Tales of the Willows)</h2><p><p>For now, in an act of homage and celebration, William Horwood has brought to life once more the four most-loved characters in English literature: the loyal Mole, the resourceful Water Rat, the stern but wise Badger, and, of course, the exasperating, irresistible Toad. The result is an enchanting, unforgettable new novel, enlivened by delightful illustrations, in which William Horwood has recaptured all the joy, magic, and good humor of Grahame's great work - and Toad is still as exasperatingly lovable as he ever was.</p></p><p>Traditionalists might well shudder at the thought of a sequel to a classic--especially one written by an author other than the original. But even devout fans of Kenneth Grahame's <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> will breathe more easily once they pass the first sentence of <i>The Willows in Winter</i>. William Horwood, while resisting slavish mimicry, remains true to the spirit of the original. Not many writers could follow such a tough act, but Horwood manages to create a story every bit as heartwarming and exciting as the first. Blustery Toad is up to his naughty old tricks, after a long period of enforced goodness. Through a comedy--and near-tragedy--of errors, Toad, along with resourceful Rat, loyal Mole, and wise Badger, is drawn into an extended wild goose chase that lasts all winter. With plummeting airplanes, tumbles in the freezing river, and courtroom high drama, this is not to be a winter of cozy hibernation. Patrick Benson's finely crosshatched illustrations transport the reader back to the familiar River and the always-looming great Wild Wood. Horwood and Benson's masterful teamwork is a tribute to the 90-year-old classic that Grahame himself would have been proud to see.

And this time around, our intrepid sleuth may have met her match: she's just been pressed into service as chaperone for the church youth group. Ten hormonally challenged teenage boys and girls are spending a week at Camp Pearly Gates, accompanied by the formidable wife of the mayor, the high school shop teacher, and preacher Brother Verber. It's bad enough that Arly has to bunk with this crew, but when, on a dark and stormy night, one of the girls stumbles over the body of a white-robed woman with a shaved head, Arly knows things can only go downhill.<br>Investigating the murder, Chief of Police Hanks finds herself hindered by an eccentric cast of characters, from the bumbling local police and a band of spacey cultists to her own menopausal mother and an oddly intriguing (and attractive) fisherman called Jacko. Meanwhile, back in Maggody, Arkansas (population 755), Mayor Jim Bob Buchanon is up to his usual philandering antics, Raz Buchanon is looking for an animal companion to keep his pig Marjorie company, and Duluth Buchanon's wife has gone missing with their two sons.</p><p><b>Joan Hess</b> is the author of twenty-four mysteries, including fourteen in the Maggody series.

She lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> To every thing, there is a season, be it football, baseball, Easter eggs, blushing brides, or professional bowling. This season in particular, heralded by the vernal equinox, had wafted in with honeysuckle-scented breezes, daffodils in starchy yellow tutus, belligerent thunderstorms, and the annual tsunami of hormones in the corridors of the high school -- evidence of which could be found strewn along the banks of Boone Creek in the aftermath of moonlit nights. There may also have been a time to every purpose under the heaven, but it was hard to discern. </p><p> Especially for professional bowling. </p><p> I was in the front room (one of two, the other designated as the back room) of the red-bricked police department, situated catty-corner to the antiques store and with a clear view of the one stoplight in town, studying seed catalogues as if I might do something of a more botanical bent than planting my fanny in my cane-bottomed chair. Crime had skidded to a halt in Maggody, Arkansas, as far as I knew. The gingham curtains flapped sluggishly as I waged an internal debate: petunias versus marigolds, cucumbers versus zucchini. The possibilities were endless and the photographs lush. The tomatoes were worthy of excessive salivation when envisioned with four strips of crispy bacon and a generous slathering of mayonnaise between two slices of white bread. Only Yankees defile such perfection with lettuce. </p><p> My official title was Chief of Police Arly Hanks; defender of law, order, justice, the American way, and whatever else I'd been hired to do, having been the sole applicant with qualifications, or without, for that matter. My job mostly consisted of nailing speeders at the edge of town -- I run a quality speed trap -- and tracking down miscreants who failed to pay at the self-service pumps. Leaping over tall buildings in a single bound was not a challenge, since Maggody lacked them. Bank robberies were not a threat, the branch having burned to the ground a while back. Ditto the post office, as well as the Esso station out by the one-lane bridge. The block or so of what had been thriving businesses thirty years ago was now a stretch of hollow shells, the windows taped with bleached newspapers and flyers promoting events that had long since come and gone. Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King were not vying for the best location, and about all we could hope for was Toys Were Us. </p><p> There had been some bizarre moments, but these days we were reduced to Saturday night temper tantrums at the pool hall, a rare flareup on the bench outside the barbershop, and my dedicated (depending on the weather, anyway) attempts to find Raz Buchanon's moonshine operation up on Cotter's Ridge. For the most part, Maggody, Arkansas (population 755), was percolating just fine. Having come home to recuperate after a nasty divorce from a New York City advertising hotshot with silk boxers and a polyester mindset, I wanted nothing more than the opportunity to pull myself back together. And, well, a bacon and tomato sandwich, washed down with a cold beer and topped off with a slice of lemon meringue pie. </p><p> I was pondering where I might actually plant tomatoes when, to my deep dismay, the door burst open and Dahlia (nee O'Neil) Buchanon thundered into the PD. Three hundred plus pounds does thunder. </p><p> "Fire!" she shrieked. </p><p> "I don't smell smoke." </p><p> "At Ruby Bee's!" </p><p> Ruby Bee's Bar &amp; Grill, for the unenlightened, is the establishment owned by my very own mother, whose nickname is short for Rubella Belinda, the family having an unfortunate tradition of choosing names for their melodic impact rather than pathology. The peculiar pink building is a hundred yards down the road from the PD, and the source for the majority of my carbohydrates, as well as all the local gossip, from Elsie's bunions to Mayor Jim Bob Buchanon's latest, but surely not last, excursion into infidelity. </p><p> "What do you mean?" I asked. </p><p> "I mean there's a fire, darn it! I was taking the babies for a walk, then I saw the smoke and -- " </p><p> I stumbled to my feet. "A fire?" </p><p> "I swear," Dahlia said, wiping her cheeks with a tissue she'd pulled from a pocket hidden among the folds of her dress, "sometimes I wonder if you was huntin' wiffle birds when God passed out the brains. Smoke's pouring out of the bar. Bocaraton liked to run me over driving out of the parking lot, and Estelle is there, screeching to high heavens. It seems to me you might want to look into this, it being your mother and all." </p><p> Dahlia was far from being the tightest-wrapped Twinkie in the carton, but she had a point. I went around her and out to the edge of the road, sidestepping the double stroller constraining a pair of pensive, thumb-sucking passengers. Smoke was indeed pouring out of the bar, and an impromptu demolition derby was shaping up. Estelle Oppers, my mother's best friend and coconspirator in high crimes and misdemeanors, was flapping her arms like a woodpecker that had chanced upon a nest of plump termites. </p><p> "Did someone call the fire department in Hasty?" I asked Dahlia. </p><p> "How am I supposed to know that? I was a fire-drill monitor in sixth grade until Miz Myner caught me smoking in the girls' restroom. I was always real careful to put my butts in the toilet, but she still took away my badge and gave it to pimply ol' Himroyd Buchanon. He cackles about it to this day." She put her fists on what I supposed were her hips and stuck her face in mine; it was likely that one of us was on a sugar-high, and not from gazing at photographs of sweet potatoes. "Why doncha ask him if he called 'em, assuming you can lure him out of the root cellar behind his house? What's it been now -- four years?" </p><p> I left her grumbling and hightailed it to the parking lot. There were no flames visible, but the smoke was hard to ignore, as well as the chaotic retreat of trucks, cars, and errant husbands who had no business guzzling beer at noon with their busty sweeties from the Pot O' Gold trailer park at the south end of town. </p><p> Estelle grabbed my arm. "You got to do something!" </p><p> "Is Ruby Bee in there?" </p><p> "She's in the kitchen with the fire extinguisher. I did my best to drag her out, but -- " </p><p> I yanked myself free and barged inside. The fire seemed to be contained, but I could hear Ruby Bee howling, although in outrage rather than in pain. I snatched a thick wad of napkins from a dispenser, then took a deep breath, covered my mouth and nose, and opened the kitchen door. Smoke roiled at me, stinging my eyes and seeping through the napkins to scald my throat. </p><p> Ruby Bee was wielding the fire extinguisher with the confidence of a seasoned urban firefighter, swinging back and forth as she blasted the flames licking on the stove. If she were up against a dragon, I knew where I'd put my money. </p><p> "Git out of here!" she snarled without turning around. "I already said it's under control." She added a few comments that do not bear repeating, although I will admit I was impressed with her command of four-letter words. My fiftyish mother, with her rosy face, ruffled apron tied around a thick waist, pink eye shadow, and suspiciously blonde hair, could have matched any sailor in a bar in San Diego, hands down. </p><p> Forget I said that. </p><p> The fire was pretty much gasping its last. I opened the back door and the windows, then sat on a stool and waited until she set down the fire extinguisher. She and everything else, including me, were coated with a slimy film of yellowish powder. </p><p> "Grease fire, huh?" I said. </p><p> "Guess I don't have to call in a rocket scientist after all," she said as she used her apron to blot her eyes. "What happened was I was frying up some chicken when the phone rang. Duluth was carryin' on like circus elephants was putting up tents in his backyard, then Mrs. Jim Bob came in and started yacking at me about chaperoning a field trip.

Now, <i>Family Furnishings </i>will bring us twenty-five of her most accomplished, most powerfully affecting stories, most of them set in the territory she has so brilliantly made her own: the small towns and flatlands of southwestern Ontario. Subtly honed with the author's hallmark precision, grace, and compassion, these stories illuminate the ordinary but quite extraordinary particularity in the lives of men, women, and children as they discover sex, fall in love, part, quarrel, head out into the unknown, suffer defeat, and find a way to be in the world.<br><br>As the Nobel Prize presentation speech reads in part: "Reading one of Alice Munro's texts is like watching a cat walk across a laid dinner table. A brief short story can often cover decades, summarizing a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in thirty pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in three hundred. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and...the master of the contemporary short story."</p><p>Alice Munro grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario. She has published thirteen collections of stories and a novel. During her distinguished career she has been the recipient of many awards, including two Giller Prizes, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Man Booker International Prize. In 2013 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her stories have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, The Paris Review, Granta</i>, and many other publications, and her collections have been translated into thirteen languages. She lives in Port Hope, Canada, on Lake Ontario.Too Much Happiness<br> &nbsp;<br> Many persons who have not studied mathematics confuse it with arithmetic and consider it a dry and arid science. Actually, however, this science requires great fantasy.<br> &#x2014;Sophia Kovalevsky<br> &nbsp;<br> On the first day of January, in the year 1891, a small woman and a large man are walking in the Old Cemetery, in Genoa. Both of them are around forty years old. The woman has a childishly large head, with a thicket of dark curls, and her expression is eager, faintly pleading. Her face has begun to look worn. The man is immense. He weighs 285 pounds, distributed over a large frame, and being Russian, he is often referred to as a bear, also as a Cossack. At present he is crouching over tombstones and writing in his notebook, collecting inscriptions and puzzling over abbreviations not immediately clear to him, though he speaks Russian, French, English, Italian, and has an under- standing of classical and medieval Latin. His knowledge is as expansive as his physique, and though his speciality is governmental law, he is capable of lecturing on the growth of contemporary political institutions in America, the peculiarities of society in Russia and the West, and the laws and practices of ancient empires. But he is not a pedant. He is witty and popular, at ease on various levels, and able to live a most comfortable life, due to his properties near Kharkov. He has, however, been forbidden to hold an academic post in Russia, because of being a Liberal.<br> &nbsp;<br> His name suits him. Maksim.

When he hurt his leg in a mishap on the ice, she helped him with the soaking and dressing and, what was more, she told people about it. She was so sure of herself then, and especially sure of him. She wrote a description of him to a friend, borrowing from De Musset.<br> &nbsp;<br> He is very joyful, and at the same time very gloomy&#x2014; <br> Disagreeable neighbor, excellent comrade&#x2014; <br> Extremely light-minded, and yet very affected&#x2014; <br> Indignantly na�ve, nevertheless very blas�&#x2014;<br> Terribly sincere, and at the same time very sly.<br> &nbsp;<br> And at the end she wrote, &#x201c;A real Russian, he is, into the bargain.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Fat Maksim, she called him then. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have never been so tempted to write romances, as when with Fat<br> Maksim.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And &#x201c;He takes up too much room, on the divan and in one&#x2019;s mind.

This may be an exaggeration, but even the remaining 1% still depends on tactics. When Martin Weteschnik started working as a trainer in his local chess club, he quickly realized that even the stronger club players had great weaknesses in their tactical play. He also discovered that simply asking them to solve a huge number of puzzles did not fix the problem. These players clearly needed a good book, but when Weteschnik looked for it he found nothing suitable, so he decided to write it himself.

Inferno refers to Dante Alighieri�s The Divine Comedy. What is Dante&#x2019;s significance? What features of his work or life inspired you?</strong></p> <p>A. <em>The Divine Comedy</em>&#x2014;like <em>The Mona Lisa</em>&#x2014;is one of those rare artistic achievements that transcends its moment in history and becomes an enduring cultural touchstone. Like Beethoven&#x2019;s Ninth Symphony, <em>The Divine Comedy</em> speaks to us centuries after its creation and is considered an example of one of the finest works ever produced in its artistic field. For me, the most captivating quality of Dante Alighieri is his staggering influence on culture, religion, history, and the arts. In addition to codifying the early Christian vision of Hell, Dante&#x2019;s work has inspired some of history&#x2019;s greatest luminaries&#x2014;Longfellow, Chaucer, Borges, Tchaikovsky, Liszt, Monteverdi, Michelangelo, Blake, Dal�&#x2014;and even a few modern video game designers. Despite Dante&#x2019;s enduring influence on the arts, however, most of us today have only a vague notion of what his work actually says&#x2014;both literally and symbolically (which, of course, is of great interest to Robert Langdon). A few years ago, I became very excited about the prospect of writing a contemporary thriller that incorporated the philosophy, history, and text of Dante&#x2019;s timeless descent into <em>The Inferno</em>.</p> <p><strong>Q. Where did do your research for Inferno? How long did you spend on it?</strong></p> <p>A. Researching <em>Inferno</em> began with six months of reading, including several translations of <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, various annotations by Dante scholars, historical texts about Dante&#x2019;s life and philosophies, as well as a lot of background reading on Florence itself. At the same time, I was poring over all the new scientific information that I could find on a cutting edge technology that I had decided to incorporate into the novel. Once I had enough understanding of these topics to proceed, I traveled to Florence and Venice, where I was fortunate to meet with some wonderful art historians, librarians, and other scholars who helped me enormously.</p> <p>Once this initial phase of research was complete, I began outlining and writing the novel. As is always the case, when a book begins to take shape, I am drawn in unexpected directions that require additional research. This was also the case with <em>Inferno</em>, which took about 3 years from conception to publication.</p> <p>With respect to the process, the success of these novels has been a bit of a Catch-22. On one hand, I now have wonderful access to specialists, authorities, and even secret archives from which to draw information and inspiration. On the other hand, because there is increased speculation about my works in progress, I need to be increasingly discreet about the places I go and the specialists with whom I speak. Even so, there is one aspect of my research that will never change&#x2014;making personal visits to the locations about which I&#x2019;m writing. When it comes to capturing the feel of a novel&#x2019;s setting, I find there is no substitute for being there in the flesh...even if sometimes I need to do it incognito.</p> <p><strong>Q. What kind of adventure will Robert Langdon face this time? Can you give us any sneak peak at the new novel?</strong></p> <p>A. <em>Inferno</em> is very much a Robert Langdon thriller. It&#x2019;s filled with codes, symbols, art, and the exotic locations that my readers love to explore. In this novel, Dante Alighieri&#x2019;s ancient literary masterpiece&#x2014;<em>The Divine Comedy</em>&#x2014;becomes a catalyst that inspires a macabre genius to unleash a scientific creation of enormous destructive potential. Robert Langdon must battle this dark adversary by deciphering a Dante-related riddle, which leads him to Florence, where he finds himself in a desperate race through a landscape of classical art, secret passageways, and futuristic technology.</p> <p><strong>Q. What made Florence the ideal location for Inferno?</strong></p> <p>A. No city on earth is more closely tied to Dante Alighieri. Dante grew up in Florence, fell in love in Florence, and began writing in Florence. Later in life, when he was exiled for political reasons, the longing he felt for his beloved Florence became a catalyst for The Divine Comedy. Through his enduring poem, Dante enjoyed the &#x201c;last word&#x201d; over his political enemies, banishing them to various rings of Inferno where they suffered terrible tortures.</p>Dan Brown is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, one of the most widely read novels of all time, as well as the international bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Inferno</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Lost Symbol</i>,<i>Angels &amp; Demons</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deception Point</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Digital Fortress</i>.

It was developed seventy-five years ago by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, and now has an international reputation being recommended by complementary and medical practitioners, cancer centres and hospices world-wide. In their first book, &#39;Essiac Essentials&#39;, Sheila Snow and Mali Klein gave detailed information on how to grow, harvest or obtain commercially the herbs necessary to make Essiac. They also gave an easy-to-follow recipe. In this new book they reveal what they have discovered of other formulae or herbs Rene Caisse may have used. They also share the information they have found in archives about the roles played by some of the more prominent figures involved with the development of Essiac, especially during the last years of Rene Caisse&#39;s life. In addition they have included information related to the basic science of cancer, the related chemical and radiation therapies and the importance of maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle in order to enhance the possibly palliative and remedial effects of the Essiac formula. The book concludes with selected case histories and a list of international resources related to Essiac.

One of the most widespread habitat types in the West, pi�on-juniper woodlands have faced extensive eradication, grazing pressures, and the encroachment of human developments, and, consequently, only a few mature stands have reached their full growth potential. Mesa Verde Country, with its deep canyons and high ridgetops, is the magnificent home of many of these ancient stands. </p><p>Impressively broad in scope, Floyd's volume thoroughly explores Mesa Verde Country's important and historic ecosystem. Covering such diverse topics as geologic evolution, natural history, human history, bats, and fungi, to name but a few, this volume will appeal to scientists, resource managers, conservationists, and the lay reader with an interest in this most western of ecosystems.

Refusing the use of sled dogs as unsporting, Scott and his team struggle to drag their heavy gear across a frozen wasteland, only to find that Amundsen has preceded them to their goal. The play is also a study of British pride and upper-class resolve&#x2014;Scott's aristocratic sense of destiny and command and his young bride's ability to understand her husband's compulsive drive while failing to accept his motivations.

This short, practical guide helps us embrace the fact of our embodiment&#x2014;the experience of the sensations, movements, and gestures of the body&#x2014;and to realize that mindfulness is the natural state of awareness of a body that has learned how to experience its feeling presence. Johnson takes us through the three primary principles of the posture of meditation: alignment, relaxation, and resilience. He devotes a large part of each chapter to specific practices to help the reader experience different aspects of physical presence. This book is of interest to meditators of all traditions&#x2014;Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, Jews, and others&#x2014;as well as therapists, bodyworkers, and anyone interested in body-centered psychology and other natural modes of healing.</p><p>"Transform the act of cooking into a dance worthy of both Nijinsky and the Buddha." This is the essence of Will Johnson's handbook for living in your body. <i>Aligned, Relaxed, Resilient</i> combines the body awareness of yoga, the life force, as Johnson puts it, of Taiji, and the mindfulness of Thich Nhat Hanh into a single and simple practice of attentive movement. Too often meditators and spiritual practitioners from all religions retreat into the head or heart, neglecting not only the health but the spiritual potential of the body. Through carefully constructed exercises, Johnson reintegrates body and mind, bringing the senses of vision, hearing, and tactile sensation into what he calls a unified field of shimmering awareness. After alignment and relaxation, the capstone of Johnson's practice is resilience, a harnessing of life force in every natural movement. Free of tension and buoyed by the earth's gravity, the body, a mass of coordinated activity, moves like a flock of starlings. When resilient movement is combined with unified sensation, the ground of being opens up to every moment's joyful apprehension.

This is the second collection of Johnny Ryan's weekly comic strip, <em>Blecky Yuckerella</em>, as seen in the pages of <em>Vice</em> magazine and elsewhere. Blecky is a four-panel gag strip in the tradition of <em>Underworld, Maakies</em>, and <em>Nancy</em>, but with much more generous portions of bodily fluids and toilet humor. Blecky Yuckerella is the ugliest girl in the second grade, and the only one with three-day stubble. The strip's cast of characters also includes Blecky's Aunt Jiggles, her best friend Wedgie, Insanio the Cat, and many other absurdist goofballs, like Rich Bucksley (millionaire and "high class idiot"), Unitard (the last retarded unicorn), the pregnant babies ("we're guaranteed to blow your mind!"), and Quasimodo Rose (the hunchback porn star). <em>Back In Bleck</em> collects over 100 strips for the first time, and his unmistakable blend of politically incorrect gags and social satire is as sharp as ever. 100 pages of black-and-white comics</p><p>Johnny Ryan&nbsp;was born in Boston, MA, and lives in Los Angeles, CA.&nbsp; He is the co-creator and co-executive producer of the Nickelodeon TV series Pig Boat Banana Cricket.</p><h2>The Lion&#39;s Bed</h2><p>Horrified at the prospect of the lion&#39;s moving to their part of the jungle, the animals set about building him a bed--but not to sleep in.</p><p></p><h2>The Sea-Thing Child</h2><p>Washed upon the beach one evening, a frightened and shaken sea-thing child is fearful of returning to the ocean, yet with the help of the new friends he meets along the way, he gains confidence in himself once again and returns to the waters he knows as home.</p><p>Grade 1-4-First published in 1972 as a chapter book, this lengthy picture-book text is slightly abridged and attractively illustrated. A "sea-thing child" washes ashore on a pebbly beach, "a little draggled heap of fright." He builds an impenetrable igloo of sea stones around himself but eventually emerges to develop a cantankerous friendship with a fiddler crab. Becoming restless, the sea-thing child converses with an eel and an albatross, both of which confidently head out to sea, but the ocean remains an enemy to the storm-battered creature. Finally, the wisdom he's absorbed, the goading of his crab companion, and a restless night conspire to awaken his latent destiny and he flies into the wind and over the waves to discover "Whatever there is!" Each spread features large, bold print opposite full-page drawings that make the story accessible to young listeners. By abbreviating many descriptive passages and eliminating repetition, the pacing moves more swiftly than in the original, but a certain elegance and lyricism are lost. At times, the motivation behind characters' actions is less obvious and the brevity results in a more cryptic unfolding of plot. Sea and sand-toned watercolors enhance the hatched illustrations; the sea-thing child, left to the imagination in the original version, is portrayed as an endearing little auklike bird here. While younger children will be attracted to the new format, they may struggle to comprehend the subliminal drama. However, the story itself remains a timeless parable about self-fulfillment that is as pertinent today as when it was first published.<br><i>Carol Ann Wilson, Westfield Memorial Library, NJ </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.A truly moving tale about discovering who you are and where you belong, enhanced by superbly moodly artwork. * Scotland On Sunday * A lovely, lovely story told in a quirky and rather beautiful way. * Children&#39;s Books in Ireland *</p><h2>After Dark</h2><p>A short, sleek novel of encounters set in the witching hours of Tokyo between midnight and dawn, and every bit as gripping as Haruki Murakami&#x2019;s masterworks <b>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</b> and <b>Kafka on the Shore</b>.<br><br>At its center are two sisters: Yuri, a fashion model sleeping her way into oblivion; and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny&#x2019;s into lives radically alien to her own: those of a jazz trombonist who claims they&#x2019;ve met before; a burly female &#x201c;love hotel&#x201d; manager and her maidstaff; and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman.

His work has been translated into 38 languages. The most recent of his many honors is the Franz Kafka Prize, whose previous recipients include Elfriede Jelinek and Harold Pinter.<b>Chapter One: 11:56 p.m.<br><br></b>Eyes mark the shape of the city. <br><br>Through the eyes of a high-flying night bird, we take in the scene from midair. In our broad sweep, the city looks like a single gigantic creature&#x2014;or more like a single collective entity created by many intertwining organisms. Countless arteries stretch to the ends of its elusive body, circulating a continuous supply of fresh blood cells, sending out new data and collecting the old, sending out new consumables and collecting the old, sending out new contradictions and collecting the old. To the rhythm of its pulsing, all parts of the body flicker and flare up and squirm. Midnight is approaching, and while the peak of activity has passed, the basal metabolism that maintains life continues undiminished, producing the basso continuo of the city&#x2019;s moan, a monotonous sound that neither rises nor falls but is pregnant with foreboding.<br><br>Our line of sight chooses an area of concentrated brightness and, focusing there, silently descends to it&#x2014;a sea of neon colors. They call this place an &#x201c;amusement district.&#x201d; The giant digital screens fastened to the sides of buildings fall silent as midnight approaches, but loudspeakers on storefronts keep pumping out exaggerated hip-hop bass lines. A large game center crammed with young people; wild electronic sounds; a group of college students spilling out from a bar; teenage girls with brilliant bleached hair, healthy legs thrusting out from micromini skirts; dark-suited men racing across diagonal crosswalks for the last trains to the suburbs. Even at this hour, the karaoke club pitchmen keep shouting for customers. A flashy black station wagon drifts down the street as if taking stock of the district through its black-tinted windows. The car looks like a deep-sea creature with specialized skin and organs. Two young policemen patrol the street with tense expressions, but no one seems to notice them. The district plays by its own rules at a time like this. The season is late autumn. No wind is blowing, but the air carries a chill. The date is just about to change.<br>We are inside a Denny&#x2019;s.<br><br>Unremarkable but adequate lighting; expressionless decor and dinnerware; floor plan designed to the last detail by management engineers; innocuous background music at low volume; staff meticulously trained to deal with customers by the book: &#x201c;Welcome to Denny&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Everything about the restaurant is anonymous and interchangeable. And almost every seat is filled.<br><br>After a quick survey of the interior, our eyes come to rest on a girl sitting by the front window. Why her? Why not someone else? Hard to say. But, for some reason, she attracts our attention&#x2014;very naturally. She sits at a four-person table, reading a book. Hooded gray parka, blue jeans, yellow sneakers faded from repeated washing. On the back of the chair next to her hangs a varsity jacket. This, too, is far from new. She is probably college freshman age, though an air of high school still clings to her. Hair black, short, and straight. Little makeup, no jewelry. Small, slender face. Black-rimmed glasses. Every now and then, an earnest wrinkle forms between her brows.<br><br>She reads with great concentration. Her eyes rarely move from the pages of her book&#x2014;a thick hardback. A bookstore wrapper hides the title from us. Judging from her intent expression, the book might contain challenging subject matter. Far from skimming, she seems to be biting off and chewing it one line at a time.<br><br>On her table is a coffee cup. And an ashtray. Next to the ashtray, a navy blue baseball cap with a Boston Red Sox &#x201c;B.&#x201d; It might be a little too large for her head. A brown leather shoulder bag rests on the seat next to her. It bulges as if its contents had been thrown in on the spur of the moment. She reaches out at regular intervals and brings the coffee cup to her mouth, but she doesn&#x2019;t appear to be enjoying the flavor. She drinks because she has a cup of coffee in front of her: that is her role as a customer. At odd moments, she puts a cigarette between her lips and lights it with a plastic lighter. She narrows her eyes, releases an easy puff of smoke into the air, puts the cigarette into the ashtray, and then, as if to soothe an approaching headache, she strokes her temples with her fingertips.<br><br>The music playing at low volume is &#x201c;Go Away Little Girl&#x201d; by Percy Faith and His Orchestra. No one is listening, of course. Many different kinds of people are taking meals and drinking coffee in this late-night Denny&#x2019;s, but she is the only female there alone. She raises her face from her book now and then to glance at her watch, but she seems dissatisfied with the slow passage of time. Not that she appears to be waiting for anyone: she doesn&#x2019;t look around the restaurant or train her eyes on the front door. She just keeps reading her book, lighting an occasional cigarette, mechanically tipping back her coffee cup, and hoping for the time to pass a little faster. Needless to say, dawn will not be here for hours.<br><br>She breaks off her reading and looks outside. From this second-story window she can look down on the busy street. Even at a time like this, the street is bright enough and filled with people coming and going&#x2014;people with places to go and people with no place to go; people with a purpose and people with no purpose; people trying to hold time back and people trying to urge it forward. After a long, steady look at this jumbled street scene, she holds her breath for a moment and turns her eyes once again toward her book. She reaches for her coffee cup. Puffed no more than two or three times, her cigarette turns into a perfectly formed column of ash in the ashtray.<br>The electric door slides open and a lanky young man walks in. Short black leather coat, wrinkled olive-green chinos, brown work boots. Hair fairly long and tangled in places. Perhaps he has had no chance to wash it in some days. Perhaps he has just crawled out of the underbrush somewhere. Or perhaps he just finds it more natural and comfortable to have messy hair. His thinness makes him look less elegant than malnourished. A big black instrument case hangs from his shoulder. Wind instrument. He also holds a dirty tote bag at his side. It seems to be stuffed with sheet music and other assorted things. His right cheek bears an eye-catching scar. It is short and deep, as if the flesh has been gouged out by something sharp. Nothing else about him stands out. He is a very ordinary young man with the air of a nice&#x2014;but not very clever&#x2014;stray mutt.<br><br>The waitress on hostess duty shows him to a seat at the back of the restaurant. He passes the table of the girl with the book. A few steps beyond it, he comes to a halt as if a thought has struck him. He begins moving slowly backward as in a rewinding film, stopping at her table. He cocks his head and studies her face. He is trying to remember something, and much time goes by until he gets it. He seems like the type for whom everything takes time.<br><br>The girl senses his presence and raises her face from her book. She narrows her eyes and looks at the young man standing there. He is so tall, she seems to be looking far overhead. Their eyes meet. The young man smiles. His smile is meant to show he means no harm.<br>Sorry if I&#x2019;ve got the wrong person,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but aren&#x2019;t you Eri Asai&#x2019;s little sister?&#x201d;<br><br>She does not answer. She looks at him with eyes that could be looking at an overgrown bush in the corner of a garden.<br><br>&#x201c;We met once,&#x201d; he continues. &#x201c;Your name is . . . Yuri . . . sort of like your sister Eri&#x2019;s except the first syllable.&#x201d;<br><br>Keeping a cautious gaze fixed on him, she executes a concise factual correction: &#x201c;Mari.&#x201d;<br><br>He raises his index finger and says, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it! Mari. Eri and Mari. Different first syllables. You don&#x2019;t remember me, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari inclines her head slightly. This could mean either yes or no. She takes off her glasses and sets them down beside her coffee cup.<br><br>The waitress retraces her steps and asks, &#x201c;Are you together?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; he answers. &#x201c;We are.&#x201d;<br><br>She sets his menu on the table. He takes the seat across from Mari and puts his case on the seat next to his. A moment later he thinks to ask Mari, &#x201c;Mind if I sit here a while? I&#x2019;ll get out as soon as I&#x2019;m finished eating. I have to meet somebody.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari gives him a slight frown. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to say that <i>before</i> you sit down?&#x201d;<br><br>He thinks about the meaning of her words. &#x201c;That I have to meet somebody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No . . . ,&#x201d; Mari says.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you mean as a matter of politeness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br><br>He nods. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I should have asked if it&#x2019;s okay to sit at your table. I&#x2019;m sorry. But the place is crowded, and I won&#x2019;t bother you for long. Do you mind?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari gives her shoulders a little shrug that seems to mean &#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d; He opens his menu and studies it.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you through eating?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hungry.&#x201d;<br><br>With a scowl, he scans the menu, snaps it shut, and lays it on the table. &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t have to open the menu,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just faking it.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari doesn&#x2019;t say anything.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t eat anything but chicken salad here. Ever. If you ask me, the only thing worth eating at Denny&#x2019;s is the chicken salad. I&#x2019;ve had just about everything on the menu. Have you ever tried their chicken salad?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari shakes her head.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not bad. Chicken salad and crispy toast. That&#x2019;s all I ever eat at Denny&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So why do you even bother looking at the menu?&#x201d;<br><br>He pulls at the wrinkles in the corner of one eye with his pinky finger. &#x201c;Just think about it. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be too sad to walk into Denny&#x2019;s and order chicken salad without looking at the menu? It&#x2019;s like telling the world, &#x2018;I come to Denny&#x2019;s all the time because I love the chicken salad.&#x2019; So I always go through the motion of opening the menu and pretending I picked the chicken salad after considering other things.&#x201d;<br><br>The waitress brings him water and he orders chicken salad and crispy toast. &#x201c;Make it really crispy,&#x201d; he says with conviction. &#x201c;Almost burnt.&#x201d; He also orders coffee for afterwards. The waitress inputs his order using a hand-held device and confirms it by reading it aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;And I think the young lady needs a refill,&#x201d; he says, pointing at Mari&#x2019;s cup.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. I will bring the coffee right away.&#x201d;<br><br>He watches her go off.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like chicken?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that,&#x201d; Mari says. &#x201c;But I make a point of not eating chicken out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Especially the chicken they serve in chain restaurants&#x2014; they&#x2019;re full of weird drugs. Growth hormones and stuff. The chickens are locked in these dark, narrow cages, and given all these shots, and their feed is full of chemicals, and they&#x2019;re put on conveyor belts, and machines cut their heads off and pluck them . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; he says with a smile. The wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepen. &#x201c;Chicken salad � la George Orwell!&#x201d;<br><br>Mari narrows her eyes and looks at him. She can&#x2019;t tell if he is making fun of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyhow,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;the chicken salad here is not bad. Really.&#x201d;<br><br>As if suddenly recalling that he is wearing it, he takes off his leather coat, folds it, and lays it on the seat next to his. Then he rubs his hands together atop the table. He has on a green, coarse-knit crew-neck sweater. Like his hair, the wool of the sweater is tangled in places. He is obviously not the sort who pays a lot of attention to his appearance.<br><br>&#x201c;We met at a hotel swimming pool in Shinagawa. Two summers ago. Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My buddy was there, your sister was there, you were there, and I was there. Four of us all together. We had just entered college, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure you were in your second year of high school. Right?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari nods without much apparent interest.<br><br>&#x201c;My friend was kinda dating your sister then. He brought me along on like a double date. He dug up four free tickets to the pool, and your sister brought you along. You hardly said a word, though. You spent the whole time in the pool, swimming like a young dolphin. We went to the hotel tea room for ice cream afterwards. You ordered a peach melba.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari frowns. &#x201c;How come you remember stuff like that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never dated a girl who ate peach melba before. And you were cute, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari looks at him blankly. &#x201c;Liar. You were staring at my sister the whole time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari answers with silence.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe I was,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;For some reason I remember her bikini was really tiny.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari pulls out a cigarette, puts it between her lips, and lights it with her lighter.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me tell you something,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not trying to defend Denny&#x2019;s or anything, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure that smoking a whole pack of cigarettes is <i>way</i> worse for you than eating a plate of chicken salad that <i>might</i> have some problems with it. Don&#x2019;t you think so?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari ignores his question.<br><br>&#x201c;Another girl was supposed to go with my sister that time, but she got sick at the last minute and my sister forced me to go with her. To keep the numbers right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you were in a bad mood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember you, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari puts her finger on her right cheek.<br><br>The young man touches the deep scar on his own cheek. &#x201c;Oh, this. When I was a kid, I was going too fast on my bike and couldn&#x2019;t make the turn at the bottom of the hill. Another inch and I would have lost my right eye. My earlobe&#x2019;s deformed, too. Wanna see it?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari frowns and shakes her head.<br><br>The waitress brings the chicken salad and toast to the table. She pours fresh coffee into Mari&#x2019;s cup and checks to make sure she has brought all the ordered items to the table. He picks up his knife and fork and, with practiced movements, begins eating his chicken salad. Then he picks up a piece of toast, stares at it, and wrinkles his brow.<br><br>&#x201c;No matter how much I scream at them to make my toast as crispy as possible, I have never once gotten it the way I want it. I can&#x2019;t imagine why. What with Japanese industriousness and high-tech culture and the market principles that the Denny&#x2019;s chain is always pursuing, it shouldn&#x2019;t be that hard to get crispy toast, don&#x2019;t you think? So, why can&#x2019;t they do it? Of what value is a civilization that can&#x2019;t toast a piece of bread as ordered?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari doesn&#x2019;t take him up on this.<br><br>&#x201c;But anyhow, your sister was a real beauty,&#x201d; the young man says, as if talking to himself.<br><br>Mari looks up. &#x201c;Why do you say that in the past tense?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why do I . . . ? I mean, I&#x2019;m talking about something that happened a long time ago, so I used the past tense, that&#x2019;s all. I&#x2019;m not saying she isn&#x2019;t a beauty now or anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still pretty, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s just dandy. But, to tell you the truth, I don&#x2019;t know Eri Asai all that well. We were in the same class for a year in high school, but I hardly said two words to her. It might be more accurate to say she wouldn&#x2019;t give me the time of day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still interested in her, right?&#x201d;<br><br>The young man stops his knife and fork in midair and thinks for a moment. &#x201c;Interested. Hmm. Maybe as a kind of intellectual curiosity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Intellectual curiosity?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, like, what would it feel like to go out on a date with a beautiful girl like Eri Asai? I mean, she&#x2019;s an absolute cover girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You call that <i>intellectual</i> curiosity?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kind of, yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But back then, your friend was the one going out with her, and you were the other guy on a double date.&#x201d;<br><br>He nods with a mouthful of food, which he then takes all the time he needs to chew.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kind of a low-key guy. The spotlight doesn&#x2019;t suit me. I&#x2019;m more of a side dish&#x2014;cole slaw or French fries or a Wham! backup singer.&#x201d;</p><h2>Best Of Baking</h2><p>Features over 330 international recipes for lavish desserts, fresh-from-the-oven breads, pizzas, and a host of goodies for family and friends on any occasion</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>WOMAN WORK NEVER</h2><p>The majority of women throughout history have spent their lives doing housework. No other occupation employs half the population or makes such an immediate impact on people's way of life. Yet the history of housework has been virtually ignored. <br><br> Caroline Davidson's pioneering book is a study of domestic life in Britain, the first country in the world to experience the effects of rapid urban and industrial growth. She discusses the development of the three utilities affecting domestic life - water, gas and electricity. She then describes in detail the most important household tasks that women didd between i65o and r95o: cooking, heating, lighting, cleaning and laundry. Further chapters are devoted to domestic servants, the time women spent on housework and the amount of help they received from their families and, finally, women's attitudes to their chief occupation. <br><br> The author has drawn on an extraordinarily wide variety of sources, provides extensive bibliographical notes and includes over a hundred illustrations, most of which have never been reproduced before. <br><br> A Woman's Work is Never Done provides a stimulating and entertaining account of the housewife's changing (and unchanging) status, as well as a unique insight into three centuries of life in the British Isles.</p><p></p><h2>Ellis Island</h2><p>The French novelist Georges Perec has continually captured the American imagination, most recently with the publication of <i>A Void</i>, a novel written without the letter &#x201c;e.&#x201d; <i>Ellis Island</i> holds us in thrall once again.

She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>A Phryne Fisher mystery, set in 1920s Australia, is as delicious and indulgent as a box of bonbons and a glass of champagne. Happily, the series has long been read by Stephanie Daniel, who does a marvelous job with the series&#39; insouciant mix of sex, silliness, and drama. She has the many voices and the pacing--as quick and light as a dance--and she&#39;s clearly having fun. In this installment, when a Jewish immigrant drops dead of poisoning in Phryne&#39;s favorite bookstore, Phryne asks her new young paramour, Simon Abraham, to introduce her to Melbourne&#39;s Jewish community. Strains of a foxtrot put you in the mood for a plot involving Jewish politics, alchemy, good food, and delicious love.

Her many poems about survival are not just quirky nature studies but acts of survival themselves.<br> Not only did the young poet join the Greenwich Village artists and writers who wanted to overthrow all her mother's pieties but she also won their admiration for the radical originality of her language and the technical proficiency of her verse. After her mother's death thirty years later, the aging recluse transformed herself, against all expectations, into a charismatic performer and beloved celebrity. She won virtually every literary prize available to her and was widely hailed as America's greatest living poet.<br> Elegantly written, meticulously researched, critically acute, and psychologically nuanced, <i>Holding On Upside Down</i> provides at last the biography that this major poet and complex personality deserves.</p></p><p><b>Linda Leavell</b> has been studying Marianne Moore's life and work for nearly three decades. Among her previous publications is the award-winning critical study <i>Marianne Moore and the Visual Arts: Prismatic Color</i>. She lives with her husband in Fayetteville, Arkansas.<i>1</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Sojourn in the Whale</i> <br> <i>December 1915</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>On the first of December 1915, Marianne Moore made her way down Fifth Avenue in search of a now famous address. This was not her first trip to New York, but it was her first venture into the city unescorted. Many visitors at the time were unnerved by the blare of motorcars and the crush of pedestrians, the incessant motion of the city. But while Marianne compared herself half jokingly to Jonah in Nineveh and his &#x201c;Sojourn in the Whale,&#x201d; the city thrilled her. She had gained a sense of independence while navigating Philadelphia on her own during college, and the brisk morning air brought back that rush of freedom. <br>Her venture began that morning at the YWCA Training Center, a recently refurbished mansion on East Fifty-second Street. She was staying there as the guest of two sisters, family friends, who hoped that she would find the mission of the YWCA as captivating as they did. For her first two days in New York, she dutifully attended training sessions with them. <br>A snapshot taken before they left home shows the three women standing next to a horse-drawn buggy. Marianne is modeling her new &#x201c;Airedale coat,&#x201d; as she called it. Her chin tucked under, she peers at the camera from beneath her most brilliant feature&#x2014;the thick auburn braid wound many times about her head. Her shirtwaist blouse with a tie at the neck and her ankle-length gored skirt make her look crisply professional like her traveling companions. <br>It was not, however, enthusiasm for the YWCA that brought the aspiring poet from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to New York. As soon as she could politely break free, she headed straight for 291 Fifth Avenue. Six years earlier she had jotted the address in her notebook when a college acquaintance told her about Alfred Stieglitz and showed her his magazine <i>Camera Work</i>. <br>Although Marianne had read avidly about new directions in the arts during the intervening years and knew all about the controversial Armory Show of 1913, she read little in that time about Stieglitz or his influential gallery. Yet 291, as the gallery was called, had quietly introduced Picasso, Matisse, and other leaders of the Parisian avant-garde to New York well before the Armory Show brought them to the attention of a broader public. The gallery did not advertise or accept commissions. Its purpose rather was to open possibilities for what art might be. Alongside lavish reproductions of photographs and drawings, <i>Camera Work</i> published articles assessing what was &#x201c;modern&#x201d; in art. And 291 was as much a gathering place for experimental painters, photographers, and writers as it was an exhibition space. Its regulars used words such as <i>honesty</i>, <i>freedom</i>, <i>enthusiasm</i>, and <i>individuality</i> to describe the <i>spirit</i> of the place. <br>When Marianne arrived at her destination, a Caribbean elevator man who had himself contributed to <i>Camera Work</i> took her to the fourth floor. She expected to find a photography studio but instead crossed the threshold of American modernism into a modest exhibition room, fifteen feet square. A green burlap curtain covered the bottom half of the walls, and a large copper bowl gathered light in the center of the room. On the gray walls above the curtain hung the brightly colored, cubist-inspired paintings of Oscar Bluemner, an architect. <br>What impressed Marianne that morning even more than the room or the paintings was Alfred Stieglitz himself. Old enough to be her father, he had a commanding white mustache and thick, disheveled hair. He repeatedly adjusted his pince-nez as he talked. <br>&#x201c;Mr. Stieglitz was exceedingly unemotional and friendly,&#x201d; Marianne recalled of this first meeting, &#x201c;and finally after telling me how he was hated, said I might come back and look at some of the things standing with their faces to the wall in a back room.&#x201d; The exhibition room had no heat; and so, having determined that Miss Moore was the kind of visitor he liked, Stieglitz invited her to the back room, where the stove was. <br>He showed her works by Picasso and Picabia and by several of his American prot�g�s, including John Marin and Marsden Hartley. (A month later he could have shown her the work of a new discovery, Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe.) He invited her to return before she left New York in case he had new things to show her and also suggested she stop by the Modern Gallery on her way back to the Training Center. There she saw recent issues of <i>Camera Work</i> and an exhibit of Van Goghs. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Little did Marianne imagine that the next winter she would herself become a regular at 291 or that within a decade she would edit an arts magazine much like <i>Camera Work</i>. For now the YWCA seemed a far more likely option for a twenty-eight-year-old woman such as herself. In college she was drawn to writers now associated with modernism&#x2014;Robert Browning, W. B. Yeats, and especially Henry James&#x2014;and she demonstrated a prescient distaste for sentimentality. But as of 1909, when she graduated, there was no modern movement in literature with which to identify. Living in Carlisle over the next six years, she read everything she could find about contemporary art, theater, music, and literature. And with nary an acceptance nor a word of encouragement for the first five of those years, she sent her cryptic, hard-edged poems to magazines such as <i>The Century</i> and <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. <br>Then in 1912 Ezra Pound, H.D., and Richard Aldington launched a new movement in poetry. Calling themselves Imagists, they rejected florid metaphor and conventional meter in favor of their own elliptical, haiku-like verses. Reading about the Imagists, Marianne learned the names of several experimental magazines and sent her work to <i>The Masses</i> in New York, <i>Poetry</i> in Chicago, and <i>The Egoist</i> in London even before seeing the magazines themselves. Immediately she began to receive the encouragement she had long sought. In the spring of 1915 her first published poems appeared simultaneously in <i>Poetry</i> and <i>The Egoist.</i> <br>When H.D. recognized Marianne&#x2019;s name in <i>The Egoist</i>, she wrote to identify herself as a Bryn Mawr classmate, Hilda Doolittle, and as Mrs. Richard Aldington. Marianne&#x2019;s poems were the finest that she and Aldington, who was poetry editor for <i>The Egoist</i>, had seen from America, H.D. said, and she urged Marianne to come to London. Yet as much as Marianne longed to accept the invitation, she could not consider leaving her mother even for a summer. <br>Just a few months after receiving H.D.&#x2019;s letter, she received one from Alfred Kreymborg accepting several of her poems for <i>Others</i>, the magazine that he edited out of his Greenwich Village apartment. He called her poems &#x201c;&#x2018;an amazing output and absolutely original&#x2019; if with his &#x2018;uneddicated consciousness&#x2019; he might judge&#x2019;&#x201d; and encouraged her to come to New York. The <i>Others</i> contributors often met, he said, to socialize and talk about poetry. Thus, when Mary Hall Cowdrey and her sister Ruth invited Marianne and her mother to go to New York, Marianne leaped at the chance. The Moores could not at the time afford clothes for both to go, and so the mother refused the invitation for herself but splurged on a new coat for her daughter. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>At four o&#x2019;clock on the same day Marianne first visited 291, she returned to the YWCA Training Center to find Kreymborg waiting for her, as planned. She had feared he might be one of the &#x201c;literary monstrosities, long-haired, speaking a lingo, etc.&#x201d; that she had read about, but the young man she met was &#x201c;quiet, dignified, dry, unpuffed up, very deliberate and kind.&#x201d; &#x201c;I was never so surprised to see anyone,&#x201d; she said afterward. Kreymborg was in turn surprised by Marianne. He later described her as &#x201c;an astonishing person.&#x201d; <br>Speaking softly but seamlessly with a hint of Missouri in her vowels, she asked Kreymborg all about the New York artists and writers of whom she had read. When she asked about Floyd Dell, editor of <i>The Masses</i>, Kreymborg said he &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t live with him.&#x201d; But Marcel Duchamp, whose <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i> had gained such notoriety at the Armory Show, was &#x201c;a lovely fellow.&#x201d; When Kreymborg asked if she had mentioned his name to Stieglitz, she said, &#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t know he knew&nbsp;&#x2026; you or any of the men who are interested in poetry.&#x201d; <br>Kreymborg was such a 291 devotee that he wanted to create a gathering of poets and artists along with his magazine. The previous summer he had launched <i>Others</i> at an artists&#x2019; colony near Grantwood, New Jersey, where the contributors often congregated for Sunday-afternoon picnics. With the onset of winter he moved to 29 Bank Street, where he both published <i>Others</i> and continued to host parties. Was there, Marianne inquired, to be such a party while she was there? He was not sure, since both he and his wife had been sick. But he invited her home to supper if she would be willing to accompany him on an errand on the way. <br>On their way to the Village, Marianne encountered her first actual bohemian. Kreymborg took her to the Madison Avenue studio of Adolf Wolff, a sculptor, poet, and anarchist who had recently been released from the political prison on Blackwell&#x2019;s Island. He first appeared leaning over the banister wearing a &#x201c;blouse,&#x201d; Marianne thought, and after they climbed four flights of stairs, he greeted her &#x201c;very limply.&#x201d; She also noted his black hair, beard, and accent. She did not say that she liked Wolff&#x2019;s poetry, but she admired his sculpture&#x2014;&#x201c;done all in right angles&#x201d; yet &#x201c;full of drollery and wit.&#x201d; <br>Marianne instantly felt at ease with Kreymborg and his wife, Gertrude. Neither of them smoked, she told her mother, nor did they exhibit any &#x201c;bohemian fierceness.&#x201d; Yet Kreymborg seemed to know everyone in the New York art world, both poets and artists. When Marianne asked about Amy Lowell, he told her about Lowell&#x2019;s lectures to the Poetry Society, a highbrow group that met in evening dress over dinner. As for Lowell herself, she was &#x201c;impossible&#x201d; and &#x201c;about so wide.&#x201d; She talked about nothing but herself and her falling out with Ezra Pound. Kreymborg did not, he confessed, like Pound&#x2019;s recent poetry but liked him personally. Marianne in turn told what she knew of H.D. and the other London Imagists and offered to put in a good word for <i>Others</i> with H.D. and Richard Aldington. After supper Kreymborg showed her photographs that Stieglitz had given him, portraits of literary figures and &#x201c;some of the most superb pictures of snow and engines and boats that I have ever seen.&#x201d; <br>In her long account of the evening afterward, Marianne clearly wished to persuade her family of her new friends&#x2019; respectability. She noted that Kreymborg wore a suit much like one of her brother&#x2019;s and emphasized the Kreymborgs&#x2019; &#x201c;silver spoons like ours&#x201d; and bookshelves &#x201c;full of the things we have, the Brownings in lambskin and Tennyson and Shelley.&#x201d; But her wall-by-wall description of the Kreymborgs&#x2019; apartment indicates that she was also beginning to envision an artist&#x2019;s life for herself. It was possible, she saw, to live among artists and writers without adopting a bohemian lifestyle. <br>Shortly after her trip, she wrote &#x201c;Is Your Town Nineveh?,&#x201d; in which she contrasts Jonah&#x2019;s desolation in the corrupt city of Nineveh with her own sense of freedom in New York. <br>It was the first of many poems she wrote over the course of her career about freedom, both personal and political. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>After the YWCA training sessions were over and the Cowdrey sisters returned to Carlisle, Marianne remained in New York for several days. She stayed in the Village with two friends who ran Varick House, a Presbyterian boardinghouse for working girls. Both Margaret and Laura were &#x201c;in ecstasies,&#x201d; Marianne said, when she brought Kreymborg to Varick House to dine with them, and Margaret thought it was &#x201c;the mark of the elect&#x201d; when Kreymborg, to her surprise, addressed Marianne by her first name. <br>Laura was a published poet herself and the older sister of the poets William Rose Ben�t and Stephen Vincent Ben�t. Marianne had known Laura and William, who were slightly older than herself, since childhood. Though she had seen little of William in recent years, he had achieved enviable success as a poet. By the time Marianne visited New York, he had published two volumes of poetry and had appeared so often in <i>The Century</i> that the magazine hired him as an editor. Laura, too, regularly appeared in magazines that rejected Marianne&#x2019;s work. Even seventeen-year-old Stephen Vincent Ben�t had published a collection of poems. <br>It was hard on Marianne that <i>The Masses</i>, known for its revolutionary politics, accepted poems by William and Laura but rejected her own. She had already determined by the time she went to New York that she and William &#x201c;had diverged and diverged until we had nothing in common aesthetically.&#x201d; Ben�t&#x2019;s poetry epitomized the conventional verse forms and complacencies against which <i>Others</i> poets defined themselves. <br>Although <i>Poetry</i> had introduced Imagism two years before the first issue of <i>Others</i> appeared, <i>Others</i> was the first of the little magazines to devote itself exclusively to experimental poetry. Despite its small circulation and as yet unknown contributors&#x2014;such as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, and William Carlos Williams&#x2014;it received much attention in the press, mostly in the form of amused ridicule. &#x201c;You know that is the most modern thing in poetry,&#x201d; opined one of Marianne&#x2019;s tablemates at Varick House, &#x201c;no rhyme, no meter, no anything, just craziness.&#x201d; <br>Only a few critics, such as J. B. Kerfoot of <i>Life</i> magazine and W. S. Braithwaite of the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>, took <i>Others</i> at all seriously. Kerfoot, a 291 associate, praised the &#x201c;revolutionary&#x201d; spirit of <i>Others</i>. &#x201c;It is the expression of a democracy of feeling,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;against an aristocracy of form.&#x201d; <br>A few days after Marianne moved her things to Varick House, she and Laura called on William Rose Ben�t at <i>The Century</i>. Having recently seen the Kreymborgs&#x2019; kitchen, where <i>Others</i> was published, and the back room of 291, where <i>Camera Work</i> was published, she noted the &#x201c;light, airy, club-like&#x201d; atmosphere of the <i>Century</i> reception room, where she and Laura waited for William to see them. Despite initial apprehensions on both sides, Marianne and William soon recovered their old friendliness, and it pleased Marianne that he showed as much interest as he did in <i>Others</i> and the new poetry. The notices by Kerfoot and Braithwaite, she decided, had made the conservatives nervous. <br>The conservatives had little to worry about. They would prevail in the popular anthologies and magazines until after World War II. Despite modernism&#x2019;s growing momentum over the next two decades, none of the modernists who now dominate anthologies&#x2014;Eliot, Pound, Stevens, Williams, H.D., and Moore&#x2014;would, for instance, win the Pulitzer Prize in poetry until Moore won it for her <i>Collected Poems</i> in 1952. Yet Stephen Vincent Ben�t had won it twice by then, and William Rose Ben�t won it as late as 1942. The Pulitzer and other accolades heaped upon Moore&#x2019;s <i>Collected Poems</i> in the early 1950s not only launched a new career for her as a celebrity but also ushered in the reading public&#x2019;s acceptance of modernist poetry. <br>During the course of her ten days in New York, Marianne did return to 291. Although Stieglitz had no new art to show her, he introduced her to J. B. Kerfoot, with whom Marianne held h...</p><h2>Odyssey (Isaac Asimov&#39;s Robot City, No. 1)</h2><p>An amnesia victim stranded on an asteroid has only robots to turn to for assistance in finding out who and where he is</p><p></p><h2>Hidden Treasures of the Romanovs</h2><p>The story of the Romanov jewels and of Englishman Albert Stopford who risked his life to smuggle millions of pounds worth of of the precious gems from Russia to London in 1917.</p><p>&#39;This is a riveting account, highly recommended for all devotees of the Romanovs.&#39; European Royal History Journal &#39; ... an absolute gem. ... wonderful illustrations.&#39; Royal Book News</p><h2>Batteries in a Portable World: A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers, Second Edition</h2><p>Batteries in a Portable World by Isidor Buchmann fills a definite need for practical information about rechargeable batteries.

Frances Wood traces the story of the civilizations and ideas that flourished and moved along its vast geographical expanse.

In reality, as Wood, head of the Chinese section at the British Library, explains, merchandise passing from Central Asia to Europe crossed over a large variety of routes before arriving at its destination, and "the number of travelers who actually traversed the full length of the Silk Roads was always very small." But the importance of the Silk Road is demonstrated by the vast cultural and religious movements that either began or flourished around it, and which are related in historical detail by the author, who traces the road to its origins as far back as Alexander the Great. This is a rich, and richly illustrated, history. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Power of a Navajo: Carl Gorman : The Man and His Life</h2><p>Artist, merchant, patriot, and a respected Navajo leader and spokesman, Carl Gorman is one of those rare people whose life encompasses the drama of an entire society.

Joshua 1:3 The new year brings hope. As we look into the year that opens before us, we would like to think that it could be better than the one behind us. That yearning for something better is a gift from God and a promise that the hope can be realized. God wants the year before you to be the best that you have ever had. The key lies in where you look for fulfillment. It must not be within yourself, for your resources have not suddenly increased. You need resources that are fresh and new and can enable you to claim a measure of effectiveness and fulfillment that you have not yet known. God is the God who wants to make all things new, and his presence can be recognized by the element of radical promise that confronts us when we come to know him. With God comes the word that the future can be better than the present. When Abraham met God, the experience contained a promise staggeringly large. It was that the barrenness of an old woman and the emptiness of a home would change. In the meeting when God met Moses was the assurance that he was made for more than defeat and shepherding. The promise was given to him that God would use him to set his people free. In fact, Moses was to be God&#39;s man to build a nation. In Joshua&#39;s relationship to God was the promise that God had a land for his wandering people. In David&#39;s communion with God, he learned that God intended to give his people a capital city, a temple, and a throne that would last forever. The Hebrew prophets told of the King who would sit on that throne, one greater than Moses or David, and of a kingdom of people with new hearts where the will of God was not an external command but an inward delight. John the Baptist announced his own role as the messenger who had come to tell the people that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. The very mark of the people of God in the Old Testament was that their faces were turned toward the future and were marked by confidence and expectation. Can we who live on this side of Bethlehem, Calvary, Easter, and Pentecost do otherwise? january 2 all things new revelation 21 He who was seated on the throne said, &#39;I am making everything new!&#39; Then he said, &#39;Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.&#39; Revelation 21:5 Yesterday we spoke of the fact that the people of God are marked by the set of their faces. They look to the future, and they look with anticipation. Implicit in fellowship with God is the promise that the best is yet to be. Of course, there are those in the Old Testament who did not see this. One who seems to be in that class is the writer of Ecclesiastes, who says that there is nothing new under the sun, that what has been will always be, that all things are wearisome, more wearisome than one can express (Eccl. 1:8--10). But this is a minority voice in the Old Testament. * The psalmist tells us of a new song that the Lord has given him (Ps. 42:8). * Isaiah writes of new things to be learned and a new name (Isa. 42:9; 62:2) and of a new heaven and a new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22). * Jeremiah proclaims a new covenant and new mercies every morning (Jer. 31:31; Lam. 3:22--23). * Ezekiel tells of a new spirit and a new heart (Ezek. 11:19; 18:31; 36:26). The New Testament picks up this theme and promises * a new birth (1 Peter 1:3), * a new life (Rom. 6:23), * a new self (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10), * a new attitude (Eph. 4:23), * a new commandment (John 13:34), * a new and living way (Heb. 10:20), * a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15), and * a new heaven and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:1). It should be no surprise for us, after we have looked at all the above, to find the concluding word coming from God himself, &#39;I am making all things new&#39; (Rev. 21:5). Apparently God never quits making things better because this word comes as the last word in human history. He is the God of eternal renewal. But what about the author of Ecclesiastes&#39; doleful words? He may be a keener observer than we thought. He says there is nothing new under the sun, and he is right. The true newness never comes from us, from the natural. It comes from beyond us, from the God with whom we have the privilege of walking. Our response has to be: Everything is new under the Son, for it is he who makes all things new. january 3 the holy one isaiah 63 In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. Isaiah 63:9 We have been thinking about the possibilities that come with the presence of God in our lives. The guarantee of that presence, though, can never be assumed. It is conditional. All of the Old Testament illustrates this. God is God alone and is to have no rival or competitor in our lives. He is offended and grieved when we let anything invade that central place intended for him. He is saddened because we inevitably suffer when we let anything encroach on his rights and place. The psalmist understood this. In Psalm 16:4 he notes that sorrows increase for those who &#39;run after other gods,&#39; so he will not participate in offerings or praises given by those with divided hearts. He confesses that Yahweh is Lord and that even the good ceases to be good when God is not in control. That is why Jesus was firm in his insistence that we should seek his rule first (Matt. 6:33). God is God alone, and he is also the Holy One. He hates all that is unclean and all that defiles. As the Holy One, he is a consuming fire. But his burning character was never intended to be destructive to us. It is his means of purging us as he did Isaiah (Isa. 6:5--7). If we care more about his presence with us than we do about our sins and uncleanness, then he will consume our defilements and make us pure. If we become more committed to our sins than we are to him, then his presence becomes destructive to us because of the corruption to which we are wedded. Israel had rejected the preaching of Jeremiah, so God permitted Ezekiel to witness the removal of his presence from Jerusalem. Ezekiel watched as the glory of God, his holy presence, rose from above the ark and from between the cherubim in the Holy of Holies. He saw it move to the threshold of the temple and then leave the city and move to a distant mountaintop. God departed from his people (Ezek. 10:1--20). The result was the destruction of the temple and city and the exile of Israel for seventy years in Babylon. God the Holy One could not live with Israel&#39;s sin. The beauty of all this lies in the fact that God&#39;s presence is better than the experience or the rewards of our sin. And he has the power to make us clean. Charles Wesley understood this and sang about it: He breaks the power of canceled sin, he sets the prisoner free; his blood can make the foulest clean, his blood availed for me.* If we let the Holy One purge us, we will have reason to sing as well.</p><h2>A Killer&#39;s Christmas in Wales: A Penny Brannigan Mystery</h2><p><p>As the townsfolk of the Welsh valley town of Llanelen settle in for the snowiest winter in twenty-five years, an American stranger arrives. Harry Saunders charms the ladies, one of them in particular: Evelyn Lloyd, the town's former postmistress, who was left comfortably off after the death of her husband. After Mrs. Lloyd invests a good deal of money with him, Harry goes missing, as does her money. His body is soon discovered outside the walls of Conwy Castle, and Mrs. Lloyd is implicated in the murder.</p><p>Although Penny Brannigan and her business partner, Victoria Hopkirk, are busy overseeing the grand opening of their new spa, that doesn't stop Mrs. Lloyd from desperately seeking Penny's help to prove her innocence. It's quite possible that Harry made other enemies while in Llanelen and Penny's investigation unfolds while she juggles her work at the spa, her growing relationship with Detective Inspector Davies, and the Christmas window competition that she signed up to judge.</p><p>With <i>A Killer's Christmas in Wales</i>, Elizabeth J. Duncan delivers a delightful holiday-themed mystery.</p></p><p><b>Elizabeth J. Duncan</b> is the first Canadian writer to win the Malice Domestic Best First Traditional Mystery Novel Competition for <i>T</i><i>he Cold Light of Mourning</i>. She has been a finalist for the Agatha and Arthur Ellis Awards. She enjoys spending time each year in North Wales and lives in Toronto with her dog, Dolly. She teaches in the public relations programs at Humber College.<b><i>One</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>On a dark gloomy morning in early November, Penny Brannigan placed her spoon in her empty cereal bowl, finished her cup of coffee, looked up from the newspaper spread out on the table before her and, taking off her reading glasses, gazed about the small kitchen with both pleasure and anxiety. Work on the charming period cottage that was now her home was almost finished, and while she was pleased with the results, the spa was turning out to be a different story.<br>Not for the first time, she wondered what she had let herself in for. Just a few short months ago her life had been relatively uncomplicated and uneventful. She&#x2019;d owned a small manicure shop in a picturesque North Wales market town where people went quietly about their business, she belonged to an artists sketching group, and she enjoyed rambling about the beautiful countryside painting watercolours and selling them in local galleries. She was reasonably content with the way her life was turning out and the universe had been unfolding as it should.<br>But recently, following the death of retired schoolteacher Emma Teasdale, Penny had inherited a cozy cottage that was now undergoing a complete makeover while she and her friend and business partner, Victoria Hopkirk, were converting a derelict stone building beside the River Conwy into an up-market spa. And bearing silent witness to the enduring accuracy of Murphy&#x2019;s Law, that if something can go wrong it will, the spa renovations had gone wildly wrong when workmen discovered skeletal remains in the ductwork. Remains both human and animal that so far, despite the best forensic efforts of the North Wales Police Service, remained unidentified, although it had been determined that the bones were those of a female with an estimated age of twenty-five to forty and that the animal skeleton was that of a cat.<br>There had been the kinds of setbacks and complications that come with any major building project and some, like human remains in the ductwork, that no one could have anticipated. But beyond the inconvenience of the decades-old bones, their discovery raised troubling questions that had awakened her in the middle of the night more than once.<br>Who had this woman been in life? What had she looked like? How had she died? What had gone so terribly, tragically wrong that someone, for some reason, had removed grille work, stuffed the remains of a woman and a cat bundled in a tatty old duvet into the ductwork, and replaced the grille, leaving the remains to decompose in their dark, secret place for decades?<br>While the police had been dusting off old missing persons records and reviewing computer databases, Penny had gone through back issues of the local newspaper to see if she could turn up anything. She scanned microfiche copies going back years, searching for a story of a local woman gone missing. Although she had found nothing, she knew that the answer was out there somewhere. It always is. Someone knows, she thought. Someone always knows. The police had told her that the DNA results were expected soon and she hoped that encoded within them would be the information to reveal the identity of this poor woman. If not, she wondered if the police would go to the trouble and expense of having a forensic sculptor create a facial reconstruction based on the woman&#x2019;s skull to attempt to reveal what she might have looked like at the time of her death.<br>Enough of this, she told herself firmly, bringing her thoughts back to the morning about to unfold. Victoria will be wondering where I&#x2019;ve got to. Best get on. She pushed her chair back, gathered up the newspaper for the recycling, and set her cup and bowl in the sink. As she opened the back door to get a sense of the weather, as she did every morning, a draught of damp, frosty air rushed past her. Her eyes swept over the walled garden, taking in the pile of brittle, withered leaves that had been blown into the corners, and then turned upward, toward a sky the colour of a bruised plum. It&#x2019;ll be tipping down rain, and a cold rain at that, before the morning&#x2019;s over, she thought. Swirls of mist wreathed the trees and shrouded the ancient hills that overlooked the town, cloaking them in mysterious foreboding. She closed and locked the door and, crossing her arms over her chest, headed upstairs in search of a warm sweater to wear under her raincoat. She&#x2019;d need both.<br>A trim, smart-looking woman in her early fifties, Penny had arrived in the town of Llanelen many years earlier as a recent university arts graduate looking for a place to stay for a night or two. Days turned into weeks and still she stayed, reluctant to leave but not knowing quite what was binding her to the town. Temporary accommodation became permanent as she began to acquire the necessary things of daily living, small and few at first, then larger and more of them, those items that add comfort, familiarity, and civility to one&#x2019;s life, like books and art supplies and clothes for a new season. And one day, she realized that while she had been making friends, starting and growing her manicure business, drawing and painting, twenty years had slipped away. She rarely thought of her native Canada and the few family members she had left behind. Her life was here now.<br>As she was looping a scarf around her neck, her mobile rang. She checked the number, then smiled.<br>&#x201c;Hello, you.&#x201d;<br>Detective Chief Inspector Gareth Davies of the North Wales Police. Another recent addition to her life and, without question, the most welcome complication of all.<br>She listened for a moment.<br>&#x201c;So there&#x2019;s no match. That&#x2019;s disappointing.&#x201d; The DNA results were in on the skeletal remains found in the spa ductwork, he&#x2019;d told her, but unfortunately they did not match anything on file.<br>&#x201c;We have to find out who she was and how she came to be there,&#x201d; Penny told him. &#x201c;You will keep looking, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>Davies reassured her, and after they said their goodbyes, Penny hung up and looked at her watch.<br>There&#x2019;s so much still to be done, she told herself as she opened the front door, reaching in her pocket for her gloves. And what with Christmas still to sort out and the spa to get up and running, there&#x2019;s no time to dwell on anything else, even an unidentified body.<br>And today, being Thursday, she&#x2019;d have to make sure everything in the shop was ready for her most demanding client.<br>She checked to make sure she had her house key, pulled the door behind her, and set off for her salon.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Elizabeth J.

For a country whose ancient heritage had placed it at the center of western culture, this late entry into nationhood and rapid reach for power would bring frequent crisis. In this fully revised edition of his classic history of the country, Denis Mack Smith provides a complete and engaging narrative of the fate of Italy from <i>Risorgimento</i> to the present.<br>For sixty years after 1861 Italy was governed by a liberal oligarchy under a parliamentary constitution. Italy chose the winning side in the First World War, but the enormous costs of victory revealed social tensions and constitutional weaknesses that prepared the way, after 1920, for Europe's first fascist dictatorship. <br>After the painful civil war that followed World War II, Italy rediscovered liberal democracy, and under a new republican regime became one of the major industrialized countries of the world.<br>First published in 1958 as <i>Italy: A Modern History</i>, the book has been substantially rewritten with a new section on the period after 1945, a new bibliography, new maps, and updated factual appendices. Stylish, clearly written, deeply informed and often controversial, it remains the definitive account for anyone interested in modern Italy.<br>". . . an extraordinarily good and concise introduction to the scandals that almost destroyed the Italian Republic." --Alexander DeGrand, North Carolina State University<br>"No one will be surprised that in this new edition Mack Smith recounts the recent history of the Republic up to 1996 with the same shrewd authorial eye, both distant and perceptive, the deep knowledge, and the skill that made the older edition of this book a classic." --Raymond Grew, University of Michigan<br>Denis Mack Smith is a Fellow of the British Academy and Wolfson College, Oxford, and a foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Among his recent books are <i>Italy and Its Monarchy</i> (1989) and <i>Mazzini</i> (1994). </p>A magisterial study that will continue to be the benchmark for political histories of modern Italy. Mack Smith (Oxford Univ.) is considered the foremost historian of modern Italy in the English-speaking world, the author of biographies on Mussolini, Garibaldi, Mazzini and Victor Emanuele, and Cavour. Mack Smith has also written on Italy's unification and its monarchy. First published in 1959, the present work is fully updated (to 1996) and has been substantially rewritten. It is the most comprehensive and accessible study we have of modern Italy. The author is partial to the liberal-conservative tradition, but this in no way prevents him from criticizing the many faults of liberal Italy as it developed after unification: Social and economic problems were exacerbated rather than solved (or even addressed); the virus of nationalism and the myth of a Roman empire were carelessly and recklessly promulgated; and perhaps most dangerous of all, the political elite failed to forge a true civic culture after centuries of foreign and domestic despotism. The recent corruption scandals that have rocked the country and destroyed the old political order had their roots in the immediate postwar period, while we now know that the threat of terrorism was much graver from the shadowy Right than from the more dramatic Left. Mack Smith ends on a note of cautious optimism but the reader might come away a bit more pessimistic. Simplya classic. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Throughout Harding's supremely evocative, scrupulously researched portrait, the stench of the huddled masses is practically palpable. But there's more foul here than the city's streets: Sir Thomas Springall, a nobleman of the court, has been poisoned, and the servant who bore the fatal cup has apparently committed suicide. Enter Sir John Cranston, the London coroner who makes Jack Falstaff look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, and whose appetite for drink is reflected in his ample girth. Together with his clerk, Brother Athelstan, a canny priest with a "nose for mischief," Cranston ferrets out a fiendish plot that reverberates with intrigue in high places. Minor flaws--the titular architectural feature has scant significance, and Athelstan's character lacks focus--barely detract from this vivid, intricately crafted whodunit. And the book is full of colorful characters such as Watkin the dung collector, Ranulf the ratcatcher and a constable at Tower Bridge who lovingly combs the hair of executed traitors and sings them lullabies. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.P.C. Doherty, writing as Harding, launches yet another historical mystery series, this one featuring a medieval coroner of Falstaffian girth and deplorable manners, Sir John Cranston, and his able assistant, Brother Athelstan, a guilt-riddled Dominican, who takes careful notes of crime scenes, interrogations, and so forth when Sir John is sleeping off a tankard or two too many. In their introductory case, they're sent to investigate a murder/suicide: Sir Thomas, it seems, was poisoned by his servant Brampton, who then, in remorse, killed himself. But if that's so, why are so many others who were present that night also soon found dead? Has any of it to do with the affair between Sir Thomas's widow and his brother? The death of a sodomized page? The blackmailing of the young king's regent, who was conniving for the throne? Sir John and Athelstan painstakingly re-create Sir Thomas's death scene to wrest a confession from the guilty--and reveal a locked-room scenario as cunning as any ever devised by John Dickson Carr. Clever puzzle, bustling atmosphere, and one hopes the curmudgeonly Sir John will be toned down and made more likable in future endeavors. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The meditation&#x2019;s words contain, as Sergei O. Prokofieff states, &#x201c;the quintessence of the whole of Anthroposophy.&#x201d; Thus, Rudolf Steiner was bestowing on the members the possibility of dealing resolutely with the specific tasks that awaited them. <br><br>In this short, potent volume, the author suggests further that "The Foundation Stone Meditation" represents the concerns of every individual of our time, allowing each of us to maintain our humanity in the face of the challenges and catastrophes of both the present and the future.<br><br>Steiner said that one could hear the words of the meditation &#x201c;sounding&#x201d; in one&#x2019;s heart. This process of &#x201c;hearing&#x201d; will acquire even more significance and reality in future, and can be of enormous help to anyone who opens themselves to it. It is against this background that Selg has written this introductory book: to promote awareness of the meditation, understanding of its historic place in the catastrophic twentieth century, and its critical but latent contribution to the future.</p><p><b>Peter Selg</b>&nbsp;was born in 1963 in Stuttgart and studied medicine in Witten-Herdecke, Zurich, and Berlin.

It had</i> been doing so, Jack thought in disgust, ever since he set foot in this benighted land. Sometimes the water fell in slanted sheets, lashing him like bits of iron; other times, it subsided into a steady, miserable drizzle. But even when the rain stopped briefly, mist still hung over everything, as if the very air were so laden with moisture it could not hold it.<br> <br>A cold drop of water slid between cloth and skin, trickling down his back, and Jack turned up the collar of his greatcoat as he gazed out across the bleak landscape. The road&#x2014;if this rutted, narrow path could be termed that&#x2014; cut across thick mats of heather and disappeared into the distance. There were few trees between him and the gray curtain of mist, only the brown and green land and a few scrubby bushes. Off to his right, a trench had been dug into the ground, exposing a straight wall of black earth. Rocks of all sizes dotted the lumpy, irregular ground, adding to the image of desolation.<br> <br>What had possessed him to come to Scotland?<br> <br>He had asked himself that question last night as he&#x2019;d lain on the thin straw mattress in the grim little inn in Kinclannoch&#x2014;indeed he&#x2019;d asked it almost nightly for the past week, and had still not come up with a satisfactory answer. There was no reason to see the house that was now his or to talk to the people who worked on the estate. His only desire was to sell the place, which fortune had dropped in his lap like an overripe plum. Whatever little tickle of proprietary instinct had made him want to see it, whatever odd pull he&#x2019;d felt at the thought of being a landed gentleman, the truth was his impulsive journey up here to claim the estate made him as big a fool as the bird-witted Scotsman who had wagered his home on the turn of a card.<br> <br>Still, it made even less sense to turn back now, when he had drawn so close to his destination. If he had understood the innkeeper&#x2019;s thick brogue, the house could not be much farther.<br> <br>His horse whickered and shifted as a gust of wind whipped through them, driving the rain into Jack&#x2019;s face and nearly taking his hat with it. He grabbed the once elegant, now sodden, hat, jamming it more firmly down on his head, and leaned over to stroke a soothing hand down the horse&#x2019;s neck. &#x201c;Steady on, Pharaoh.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now, blown by the wind, the mist receded, and he could see the narrow loch and, at last, the house. It lay on a shelf of rock beside the water, a long, straight line of stone unbroken by curve or ornamentation. As gray and dreary as the loch and the sky above it, the house might have been formed out of this bleak landscape itself.<br> <br><i>Baillannan</i>.<br> <br>If Jack had harbored some hope that the sight of his new home would lighten his mood, he knew now he was doomed to disappointment. Nothing could have looked less welcoming. Suppressing a sigh, he dug in his heels started forward.<br> <br><br> <br>Isobel was carefully pulling out the last few stitches in her embroidery when her aunt startled her by exclaiming, &#x201c;We have a visitor! How nice! Barbara, did you know someone was coming?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isobel,&#x201d; she corrected automatically, and her aunt nodded vaguely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, dear, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; Isobel set aside her needlework and stood up, suddenly hopeful. &#x201c;Is it Andrew?&#x201d;<br> <br>Aunt Elizabeth squinted down at the courtyard below. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s anyone I recognize.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A stranger?&#x201d; Isobel joined her aunt at the window, but their visitor had already disappeared, and she saw nothing but the groom leading off an unfamiliar bay horse.<br> <br>&#x201c;He looked soaked, poor man,&#x201d; Elizabeth went on sympathetically. &#x201c;Perhaps he&#x2019;s a traveler seeking shelter from the rain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A traveler to where?&#x201d; Isobel asked pragmatically. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my guess he&#x2019;s gone astray. No doubt Hamish will set him straight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would have been nice to have a visitor,&#x201d; her aunt said wistfully. &#x201c;So many people have left, one hardly sees anyone anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, since the Clearances began, our closest neighbors are now sheep,&#x201d; Isobel agreed tartly.<br> <br>&#x201c;The MacKenzies would not have sold if Ronald was still alive. Poor Agnes; she will not enjoy living in Edinburgh, however much her son may have profited.&#x201d;<br> <br>Agnes MacKenzie had been Elizabeth&#x2019;s closest friend, and Isobel&#x2019;s aunt had been lonely with her gone. Isobel could not help but feel that the loss had affected Aunt Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind as well as her spirits; she had grown more forgetful the last few months.<br> <br>Isobel murmured a vague agreement, not wanting to set her aunt off on that unpleasant path. She returned to the sofa and picked up her embroidery hoop, saying, &#x201c;I fear I&#x2019;ve made a shambles of my stitches. What do you think I should do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth was distracted by Isobel&#x2019;s plea for help, and she started toward her niece. But she had scarcely taken a step when the quiet was interrupted by the sound of a voice rising in agitation downstairs. Surprised, both women glanced toward the door. A moment later, there was the clatter of feet on the stairs, and one of the maids burst into the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Isobel!&#x201d; The girl&#x2019;s face was flushed and her voice trembled with excitement. &#x201c;Hamish says come quick. There&#x2019;s a man here, claiming Baillannan is his!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Isobel stared at the girl. Her words were so absurd that Isobel thought she must not have heard the maid correctly.<br> <br>&#x201c;A man, miss, at the door. An Englishman. He says he owns Baillannan. Then Hamish says he maun be daft, but the man says, &#x2018;Nae, it&#x2019;s mine,&#x2019; and shows him a paper, and Hamish sends me to fetch you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isobel...&#x201d; Aunt Elizabeth turned toward her, frowning. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. An Englishman, here? Who is he? What does he mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no idea. It&#x2019;s nonsense, of course.&#x201d; Isobel started toward the hall. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Auntie, I will straighten it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the foot of the staircase Isobel was met by the sight of Hamish, the man who had been the Rose family butler all her life, standing, arms crossed, as if he would bar the man from the stairs physically. His weathered face, usually set in stoic, even grim, lines, was red as a beet, bushy brows drawn together, dark eyes glittering with dislike.<br> <br>Opposite him stood a stranger, tall and dark-haired, his face creased in frustration. He would have been a handsome man, she thought, if he had not been soaked to the skin, his cravat a soggy lump around his neck, starched collar points utterly wilted, and his fine wool jacket stretched out of shape by the weight of the water it had absorbed. He held a waterlogged hat in one hand and a many-caped, gray greatcoat hung over the same arm, both of them puddling water on the stone floor beneath him. His boots were caked with mud, and between the sides of his open jacket, his wet shirt clung to his chest. It was made of fine lawn and the water had turned it almost transparent, so that she could see every line and curve of his chest and stomach. As she watched, he reached up and shoved the mop of hair back from his face, stripping water from it. His hair was thick, and slicked back as it now was, it left his face in sharp relief, emphasizing the square set of his jaw and the high slant of his cheekbones. An errant drop of water trickled from his temple, sliding down the skin of his cheek and curving over his jaw to disappear in the cloth of his cravat.<br> <br>Isobel realized that she was staring, and she quickly averted her eyes, a faint flush rising in her cheeks. &#x201c;Hamish? Is there a problem?&#x201d;<br> <br>The stranger looked up at her, relief flooding his face, and burst out, &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am! Thank heavens, you speak English.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel raised her brows, her voice faintly amused. &#x201c;I do indeed, sir. I believe you will find that most of us do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not so I could tell,&#x201d; he responded with a dark look at the butler.<br> <br>&#x201c;I canna help it if you dinna understand clear speech.&#x201d; Hamish set his jaw mulishly.<br> <br>The stranger ignored his retort, addressing his words to Isobel. &#x201c;If I might be so bold as to introduce myself, I am Jack Kensington, ma&#x2019;am, at your service.&#x201d; He swept her a polite bow, elegant in spite of his drenched condition.<br> <br>He was clearly a gentleman, his speech and manners as refined as those of her brother or cousin&#x2014;perhaps more so&#x2014;and she suspected that his clothes were equally sophisticated when not soaked by the rain.<br> <br>Isobel was as intrigued as she was puzzled, and she came down the last few steps and held out her hand to him. &#x201c;I am Isobel Rose, sir. I&#x2019;m pleased to make your acquaintance.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Kensington looked taken aback, but he recovered quickly and took her hand, bending over it politely. &#x201c;Mrs. Rose. An apt name for such a lovely woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Rose,&#x201d; Isobel corrected him, pulling her hand back. His words were too forward and no doubt meaningless flattery, but she could not deny the lift of pleasure at his compliment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dinna trust him, Miss Isobel,&#x201d; the butler warned, taking a step toward her protectively. &#x201c;This Englishman is trying to swick you. Or he&#x2019;s daft. He says he owns Baillannan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure his intent is not to swindle us,&#x201d; Isobel replied. &#x201c;Perhaps he has been misled.&#x201d; She turned to Kensington. &#x201c;I am sorry, sir, but you are mistaken. Baillannan belongs to the Rose family.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It did,&#x201d; Kensington responded tersely, his courteous manner giving way to irritation. &#x201c;But it is mine now. I have it from Sir Andrew Rose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Isobel stared at him in astonishment. &#x201c;Andrew would never have sold Baillannan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He did not sell it, ma&#x2019;am. He wagered it on a game of whist. And lost.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she repeated, but the blood drained from her face, and for an instant she thought she might faint. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then believe this.&#x201d; He shoved a piece of paper into her hand. &#x201c;It is Sir Andrew&#x2019;s chit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel stared at the familiar writing, the bold swoop of the<i> A</i>, and this time she did have to reach for the newel to stay upright.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Isobel?&#x201d; Hamish stepped forward anxiously and took her arm to support her. &#x201c;What is it? The young laird never&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Isobel kept her gaze on the words, now swimming before her eyes. &#x201c;I fear he did. &#x2019;Tis Andrew&#x2019;s hand. He wagered Baillannan,&#x201d; she finished bitterly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have the deed, as well,&#x201d; the Englishman added mildly.<br> <br>&#x201c;No doubt.&#x201d; Her stomach was roiling. She wanted to scream and shred the note, to toss it back in the stranger&#x2019;s face and tell her men to toss <i>him</i> back out into the rain. But she was a Rose, and so she must put iron into her spine. Isobel blinked back her tears&#x2014;she refused to let him see her cry.<br> <br>He was holding out the deed to her, and she took it, running her eyes down it as if she were reading it, when in truth she could not take in any of the words, her mind overwhelmed by something close to terror. She had no idea what to do, so she clung to the behavior that one expected from the lady of Baillannan, a stoicism that hid the turmoil inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to Baillannan, Mr. Kensington,&#x201d; she said tightly as she handed him back the papers, though she could not manage to look him in the face. &#x201c;Hamish, show Mr. Kensington to a room. I am sure he would like to get dry. And no doubt he would appreciate a cup of tea, as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Izzy!&#x201d; Hamish went an even deeper shade of red, and his eyes bulged. &#x201c;You canna mean to give him your home! Your father&#x2014;your grandfather&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hamish,&#x201d; Isobel said firmly. &#x201c;I cannot undo what Andrew has done. Baillannan apparently belongs to Mr. Kensington now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hamish set his face mutinously, but finally he bobbed his head. &#x201c;Aye, miss.&#x201d;<br> <br>He seized Kensington&#x2019;s coat and hat, grabbed up the satchel at his feet, then went to speak to the servants, shooing them toward the kitchen.<br> <br>Isobel turned back to their visitor in awkward silence, then rushed to speak. &#x201c;I apologize that your room is not ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no need to apologize. Indeed, I should do so for the shock I have given you. I thought Sir Andrew would have written, but no doubt his letter has not had time to reach you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No doubt. If you will excuse me . . .&#x201d; She gave him as close to a smile as she could muster and turned away.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, wait.&#x201d; He followed her to the foot of the staircase. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel stopped on the stairs and turned reluctantly to face him. He was a step below her, so that his head was level with hers, only inches away. His eyes, she realized, were not black or brown as she had thought, but a dark blue, shadowed by thick black lashes. The odd color, combined with the high slash of his cheekbones, gave his face a faintly exotic look. She found it unsettling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not entirely sure I understood what that fellow said, but it seemed&#x2014;are you related in some way to Sir Andrew?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am his sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His sister!&#x201d; His eyes widened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Sir Andrew never mentioned... I didn&#x2019;t know . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no reason you should.&#x201d; This time she could not manage even an attempt at a smile. Whirling, she ran up the stairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isobel?&#x201d; Her aunt stood outside the door of the sitting room, looking a trifle lost.<br> <br>Isobel pulled up short, barely suppressing a groan. Aunt Elizabeth&#x2019;s memory had been growing hazier the last few months, and Isobel had found that any unexpected occurrence tended to make her condition worse. But Isobel was not sure she could explain the situation calmly when she felt as if she might shatter into a storm of tears herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isobel, who was that man? Was he talking about Andrew?&#x201d; Her aunt&#x2019;s face brightened. &#x201c;Is Andrew here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Andrew is in London. Or at least I suppose he is, since he has not bothered to write.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is so careless that way.&#x201d; Aunt Elizabeth smiled indulgently. &#x201c;Of course, young men have better things to do than write home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He might have thought of something besides himself for once.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isobel? Are you angry with Andrew?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I am.&#x201d; She added, softening her tone, &#x201c;A bit.&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t give in to her feelings in front of Elizabeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;But why was Hamish upset? Who is that man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He knows Andrew. I&#x2014;he is staying here for a time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. How nice&#x2014;a visitor. He was quite a handsome young man, I thought.&#x201d; Elizabeth&#x2019;s eyes gleamed speculatively, and for a moment she seemed like her old self. &#x201c;It will be good for you to have someone your own age here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Isobel felt as if she might choke. &#x201c;Please, don&#x2019;t try to matchmake. It&#x2019;s impossible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Now come in and sit down and tell me all about him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I cannot.&#x201d; Isobel pulled away, ignoring the faint hurt in her aunt&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I will come back later and tell you everything I know. But right now I must go&#x2014;I&#x2014;I have to fetch something. From Meg.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her aunt frowned. &#x201c;Meg?&#x201d; &#x201c;Meg Munro, Auntie; you know Meg. Coll&#x2019;s sister. Their mother Janet was Andy&#x2019;s wet nurse.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I know Meg.&#x201d;<br> <br>The vagueness in Elizabeth&#x2019;s gray eyes made Isobel doubt her aunt&#x2019;s words. I cannot bear it, she thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;I must go,&#x201d; she repeated, and fled down the hall without looking back.<br> <br>Inside her bedroom, Isobel closed the door and sagged against it. She wasn&#x2019;t sure how she had gotten through it without breaking down. Her knees were jelly, her hands trembling. She heard the sound of footsteps and voices in the hall outside her door as Hamish and the Englishman walked past, a bitter reminder that her home was gone.<br> <br>Not just the house she had grown up in, but the loch, the earth, the rocks and caves, every inch of this land and its wild, ...</p><h2>Trade in Strangers: The Beginnings of Mass Migration to North America</h2><p><p>American historians have long been fascinated by the "peopling" of North America in the seventeenth century. Who were the immigrants, and how and why did they make their way across the ocean? Most of the attention, however, has been devoted to British immigrants who came as free people or as indentured servants (primarily to New England and the Chesapeake) and to Africans who were forced to come as slaves. <em>Trade in Strangers </em>focuses on the eighteenth century, when new immigrants began to flood the colonies at an unprecedented rate. Most of these immigrants were German and Irish, and they were coming primarily to the middle colonies via an increasingly sophisticated form of transport.</p><p>Wokeck shows how first the German system of immigration, and then the Irish system, evolved from earlier, haphazard forms into modern mass transoceanic migration. At the center of this development were merchants on both sides of the Atlantic who organized a business that enabled them to make profitable use of underutilized cargo space on ships bound from Europe to the British North American colonies. This trade offered German and Irish immigrants transatlantic passage on terms that allowed even people of little and modest means to pursue opportunities that beckoned in the New World.</p><p><em>Trade in Strangers</em> fills an important gap in our knowledge of America's immigration history. The eighteenth-century changes established a model for the better-known mass migrations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which drew wave after wave of Europeans to the New World in the hope of making a better life than the one they left behind&#x2014;a story that is familiar to most modern Americans.</p></p><p><p>Marianne S.

In Paris 1940, the three remaining Hot-Time Swingers run take after exhausted take, trying to get one right before the S.S. boots stomp their last chance. Our irascible narrator, Sid, learned to play bass lin Baltimore, with his longtime friend and rival Chip on drums, and in Berlin they'd joined up with Hiero, a half-black German &#x201c;kid&#x201d; who blows brilliant trumpet with a &#x201c;massive sound, wild and unexpected, like a thicket of flowers in a bone-dry field.&#x201d; As Hiero scratches the wax on disc after disc of imagined mistakes, Sid saves the final take--the record that will become legendary. When Hiero's arrested and sent to a Nazi camp, Sid&#x2019;s the only witness, and things look suspicious. Fifty years later, Chip and Sid return to Berlin for the opening of a film about Hiero. But Sid stands accused of engineering his disappearance, and a strange letter suggests there&#x2019;s more to the story than anyone knew. With delightfully witty jazz-cat banter, tactile imagery, and descriptions of music sensual enough to stand your hair on end, Edugyan evokes a time, a place, and a band whose refusal to repress their difference could mean death, or become a catalyst for acts of creative genius that will make them immortal. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><p><b>Esi Edugyan</b> has a Masters in Writing from Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars.

From his travelogue-sketchbooks of Vienna, London, New York, LA and Taiwan to his finished illustrations and paintings, we get to see a side of the artist that most have not seen. James's artwork blends media such as watercolor, oils, computer work, and sketching &#x2015; all of which is collected here in a beautiful hardcover format. </li></ul></p><p>Part of a new breed of visual artists operating somewhere between the realms of cartooning and traditional fine-art illustration, Jean has yet to publish any actual comics, but his award-winning covers for comic books such as Fables have put him on the map nonetheless. Much of his best work leaps from pure illustrative representation to the bold simplicity of old comic strips, seemingly within a single line. This collection is a sampling of the last five years' worth of his rough sketchbook drawings (images overlapping each other, notes to self and diary entries scribbled on the page), as well as his most impressive finished pieces-notably the "Recess" series of digitally manipulated, enormously unsettling images of school. Chris Ware's sketchbooks seem to be as big an influence on Jean as Robert Crumb's were on Ware's. He often starts by catching poses on the fly in public places, then lets his attention wander to a meticulous depiction of the setting's architecture. Most of the juice in Jean's work, though, comes from conflating hyperreal and surreal elements: impossible, grotesque images drawn with a manga-derived hardness, or rendered casually in a way that catches the subtleties of skin texture and loose-hanging cloth. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But even she can't watch an angry mob drown an Englishman. She rescues him and nurses him back to health-and falls in love.<br><br> In Patriot Boston, hers is an unforgivable sin-made worse by the fact that her Englishman turns out be the aristocratic Sir Philip Dapifer. Philip must smuggle Makepeace aboard a ship bound for London and save her life at the expense of the world she knows.<br><br> Rich in period detail, bringing the years of colonial rebellion to vivid life, <i>A Catch of Consequence</i> is a stylish novel of Boston and England, and of a woman who defies convention in both worlds.</p><p><b>Diana Norman</b> (1933-2011) worked on local newspapers in Devon and the East End of London and at age of twenty became the youngest reporter in what used to be Fleet Street. Norman authored biographies as well as historical novels. In total, she wrote 11 historical novels including <i>The Vizard Mask</i>, <i>The Pirate Queen</i>, and <i>Fitzempress' Law</i>. She is survived by her husband, film critic Barry Norman, and their two daughters.Makepeace Burke hates waste, so it is only logical that she would fish a drowning man out of the ocean. The man turns out to be Englishman Philip Dapifer, who was tossed into Boston Harbor by several Sons of Liberty protesting the Stamp Tax. Most of her customers and Makepeace herself are closely aligned with the cause for American freedom, so she tries to keep Philip hidden in her tavern until he recovers, but once Makepeace's future mother-in-law intrudes, everyone in Boston soon knows she is harboring the enemy. Forced to leave everything behind, Makepeace travels with Philip to England to begin a new life in a country she hates with a man with whom she is slowly falling in love. Resplendent with historical details, filled with beautifully crafted characters, and kissed with a subtle touch of romance, Norman's tale is historical fiction at its best. Makepeace is so irresistibly indomitable, readers will relish every moment of her unforgettable adventures. <i>John Charles</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From North and South America to Europe, from Asia, South Africa and Madagascar to Australia and New Zealand, he presents us with trees of personality and presence: Dwarfs, Giants, Monuments, and Aliens - the lovingly tended midgets of Japan; the massive &#39;General Sherman&#39; of Sierra Nevada; the Mexican Tule Bald Cypress; the enormous strangler from India now romping about the University of Palermo in Sicily; and the 4,700 year old &#39;Old Methusalehs&#39;, the bristlecone pines discovered in the White Mountains of California. From ancient yews and ginkos to colossal redwoods and fairytale baobabs, this book is the fruit of Thomas Pakenham&#39;s search for the most remarkable trees of the world.</p><p>Thomas Pakenham is the author and photographer of the bestselling MEETINGS WITH REMARKABLE TREES, and author of the critically acclaimed SCRAMBLE FOR AFRICA, which won the W.H.Smith award and the Alan Paton Award.Adult/High School-Following Meetings with Remarkable Trees (Random, 1998), which features trees in Britain and Ireland, this book sets out to discover more such natural wonders elsewhere. In Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, he finds 60 commanding giants and dwarfs, Methuselahs, shrines, and "dream" trees of many kinds. Whether he is meeting baobabs, sequoias, or banyans, he finds magnificence, beauty, and, sometimes, sadness. He has a genius for communicating his sense of each tree as an individual being, engendering wonder, awe, and respect for it in readers. His thoughtful but brisk narratives bring his travels to life and readers feel that they are participants in an adventure as he experiences trees, their ecological and historical contexts, and the challenges of creating photographs of such difficult and special subjects. And Pakenham's color photographs are truly remarkable as he conveys the tactile aspect of bark, the sense of size or majesty, or the rare moment when the light is just right to capture the spirit of the tree. Chapters are further enhanced with historical illustrations (often, earlier views of the same trees) and snippets of poetry ranging from Alfred, Lord Tennyson to Ogden Nash. Pakenham ends with a chapter on "Trees in Peril." This beautiful and unique book is sure to be appreciated by nature lovers. And though it is a highly personal work and not a scientific text, it demonstrates keen and accurate observation; it could also serve as an excellent supplement to studies in science, history, and geography.<br><i>Christine C.

Brodkey was hailed as an "unusually gifted writer" (The Atlantic) and a "rich talent" (San Francisco Chronicle), whose stories read like "murmured confidences, highly personal yet carefully contrived" (Chicago Tribune). In First Love and Other Sorrows, the young Brodkey chronicles the world of the educated and affluent middle class of the 1950s, at leisure and in love. He establishes the themes that would appear throughout his career--the painful uncertainties of childhood, the halting intimacies of social life--with rare terness, humor, and haunting insight.

An elderly woman of striking beauty is found murdered in Orleans, France. Her identity has been cleverly erased but the method of her death is very specific: she has been killed in the manner of traitors to the Resistance in World War Two. Tracking down her murderer leads police inspector In�s Picaut back to 1940s France where the men and women of the Resistance were engaged in a desperate fight for survival against the Nazi invaders. To find answers in the present Picaut must discover what really happened in the past, untangling a web of treachery and intrigue that stretches back to the murder victim&#39;s youth: a time when unholy alliances were forged between occupiers and occupied, deals were done and promises broken. The past has been buried for decades, but, as Picaut discovers, there are those in the present whose futures depend on it staying that way - and who will kill to keep their secrets safe... * &#39; A Treachery of Spies is the equal of Charlotte Gray in its insights into the period and, I would say, beats it for sheer excitement... one of the most gripping spy stories I have ever read.&#39; Jake Kerridge, S Magazine &#39;This is a rich vein for fiction, and Scott does it more than justice, with this beautifully imagined, beautifully written, smart, sophisticated - but fiercely suspenseful - thriller.&#39; Lee Child &#39;Ingeniously plotted and wonderfully written.&#39; Antonia Senior, The Times &#39;The most exquisite story of heroism, deception, love and treachery you&#39;ll find this year.&#39; Simon Mayo &#39;A fast-moving tightly-wrought thriller.

Nature was the fountainhead of his inspiration and his refuge from what he considered the follies of society.

He graduated from Harvard in 1837, the same year he began his lifelong Journal. Inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau became a key member of the Transcendentalist movement that included Margaret Fuller and Bronson Alcott. The Transcendentalists' faith in nature was tested by Thoreau between 1845 and 1847 when he lived for twenty-six months in a homemade hut at Walden Pond. While living at Walden, Thoreau worked on the two books published during his lifetime: <b>Walden</b> (1854) and <b>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</b> (1849). Several of his other works, including <b>The Maine Woods, Cape Cod</b>, and <b>Excursions</b>, were published posthumously.

Methinks that the moment my legs begin to move, my thoughts begin to flow...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;THOREAU IN HIS JOURNAL, AUGUST 19, 18511<br> &nbsp;<br> When Thoreau moved from Concord to New York in 1843, ostensibly to be the tutor for the children of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x2019;s brother, William, he was situating himself in the center of the American publishing world. Although for various reasons, including an overwhelming sense of homesickness, he returned to Concord and remained there for the rest of his life, it is clear that at this point Thoreau was determined to be a writer. Whatever else he may have been&#x2014;social reformer, naturalist, surveyor, pencil-maker, teacher&#x2014;his work, as he would write in his journal on October 18, 1856, &#x201c;is writing, and I do not hesitate, though I know that no subject is too trivial for me, tried by ordinary standards.&#x201d;2<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry David Thoreau was born David Henry Thoreau on July 12, 1817, in Concord, and he died in Concord on May 6, 1862. During his forty-four years, or, more precisely, during the twenty-four years when he was actively writing, he wrote works that have become classics of American literature&#x2014;<i>Walden</i>, a book on deliberate and purposeful living; &#x201c;Civil Disobedience,&#x201d; a treatise on a person&#x2019;s rights and duties in relation to an unjust government; and &#x201c;Walking,&#x201d; a piece on man&#x2019;s place in Nature&#x2014;in addition to writing a two-million-word journal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau&#x2019;s success as a writer lies in the truth he utters. The questions he asks himself are the questions every individual, at his or her most attentive and sentient moments, asks. As he wrote, &#x201c;These same questions that disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his ability, by his words and his life.&#x201d;3 Because the answers change, however, not only from generation to generation but for each individual from year to year, his writings are works to which we return, texts constantly reflecting our own evolution.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit,&#x201d; Thoreau wrote in the &#x201c;Reading&#x201d; chapter of&nbsp;<i>Walden</i>, &#x201c;is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written.&#x201d;4 Reading in the way Thoreau meant, you will meet with a realization that many other readers will fail to achieve, which ultimately means that a good book must not only be written by a good writer but that it must be read by a good reader.<br> &nbsp;<br> One way to be a good reader is to understand the nature of an essay. Wendell Berry defined it best in writing about Edward Abbey&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;Down the River with Henry Thoreau&#x201d;: &#x201c;It is an essay in the literal sense: a trial. Mr. Abbey tries himself against Thoreau and Thoreau against himself; he tries himself and Thoreau against the river; he tries himself and Thoreau and the river against modern times, and vice versa.&#x201d;5 This is how a reader should approach any piece by Thoreau.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau gave more than seventy lectures between his first in 1838 and his last in 1860. Sometimes he found members of his audience reading the newspaper. He once overheard one person say to another, &#x201c;What does he lecture for?&#x201d;6 But some reviews of his talks indicated a man who could move his audience. A talk on &#x201c;Economy&#x201d; in 1848 caused&nbsp;<i>The Salem Observer</i>&nbsp;to write that his lecture was &#x201c;interspersed observations, speculations, and suggestions upon dress, fashions, food, dwellings, furniture, &amp;c., &amp;c., sufficiently queer to keep the audience in almost constant mirth, and sufficiently wise and new to afford many good practical hints and precepts.&#x201d;7 And&nbsp;<i>The Eastern Argus Semi-Weekly</i>&nbsp;of Portland, Maine, wrote the following year that his talk &#x201c;was unique, original, comical, and high-falutin. It kept the audience wide awake, and pleasantly excited for nearly two hours.&#x201d;8 A decade later,&nbsp;<i>The Liberator</i>&nbsp;wrote of Thoreau&#x2019;s talk on John Brown that a &#x201c;very large audience listened to this lecture, crowding the hall half an hour before the time of its commencement, and giving hearty applause to some of the most energetic expressions of the speaker.&#x201d;9<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau wrote in his journal on December 6, 1854: &#x201c;After lecturing twice this winter I feel that I am in danger of cheapening myself by trying to become a successful lecturer, i.e., to interest my audiences. I am disappointed to find that most that I am and value myself for is lost, or worse than lost, on my audience.&#x201d;10 The lyceum, however, served as a testing ground for much of his writing. Early versions of what would become essays or sections of his books were given as lectures, some multiple times in different locations with audiences of differing backgrounds. That much of his work was originally presented, at least in part, on the lecture circuit accounts for the directness with which Thoreau approached his readers. For Thoreau there was always an audience, not an imagined reader but a real man or woman sitting in the front row looking in&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;eyes and listening to&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;words. &#x201c;I take it for granted, when I am invited to lecture anywhere...that there is a desire to hear what&nbsp;<i>I think</i>&nbsp;on some subject, though I may be the greatest fool in the country,&#x201d; he wrote in &#x201c;Life Without Principle,&#x201d; resolving &#x201c;that I will give them a strong dose of myself. They have sent for me, and engaged to pay for me, and I am determined that they shall have me, though I bore them beyond all precedent.&#x201d;11<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I would rather write books than lectures,&#x201d;12 Thoreau confessed in his journal. &#x201c;How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book,&#x201d; Thoreau wrote in&nbsp;<i>Walden</i>, perhaps understanding at this point the type of work he was trying to present. &#x201c;The book exists for us, perchance,&#x201d; he went on to say, &#x201c;which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered.&#x201d;13 With wisdom we also learn not to do desperate things such as his neighbors, living their &#x201c;lives of quiet desperation,&#x201d;14 were doing. It was important &#x201c;so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.&#x201d;15 It was pivotal to Thoreau&#x2019;s philosophy that action follow thought. &#x201c;What I began by reading,&#x201d; he wrote in 1841, &#x201c;I must finish by acting.&#x201d;16<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Thoreau wrote that &#x201c;the writer must to some extent inspire himself,&#x201d;17 no discussion of Thoreau can ignore the influence of Emerson. Although some tend to downplay the influence of Emerson over the young Thoreau, it is impossible to think of Thoreau without hearing echoes of Emerson. This in no way diminishes Thoreau but adds to an understanding of him. Emerson himself knew that it was &#x201c;easy to see that the debt is immense to past thought. None escapes it. The originals are not original. There is imitation, model and suggestion, to the very archangels, if we knew their history.&#x201d;18<br> &nbsp;<br> Emerson was one of the leading men of letters of his day and the center of the transcendental circle as well as a mentor and eventual friend to the younger author. That Emerson was an influence on Thoreau, and a strong one, was as it should be. That Thoreau could take that influence and adapt it without being overwhelmed by it was the key to his strength and individuality. He was a master at absorbing what had come before him and turning it uniquely into his own. Emerson wrote that a &#x201c;great man&#x201d; fills what he quotes &#x201c;with his own voice and humor, and the whole cyclopaedia of his table-talk is presently believed to be his own.&#x201d;19<br> &nbsp;<br> Emerson, in 1837, presented his oration, &#x201c;The American Scholar,&#x201d; to Thoreau&#x2019;s graduating class at Harvard. It is unclear whether Thoreau heard it at that time, but if he hadn&#x2019;t, he would certainly have read it later in its pamphlet form at the Emerson home. In this highly charged essay, Emerson wrote of the unfulfilled potential of young Americans in these words:<br> &nbsp;<br> Young men of the fairest promise, who begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with these, but are hindered from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire, and turn drudges, or die of disgust,&#x2014;some of them suicides. What is the remedy? They did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers for the career do not yet see, that if the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge world will come round to him. Patience,&#x2014;patience; with the shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace the perspective of your own infinite life; and for work the study and the communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the world, not to be an unit;&#x2014;not to be reckoned one character;&#x2014;not to yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear.... We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds.20<br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine the power of those words on a young Thoreau, on anyone, who was searching, trying to find out who he was, what he was about; imagine the power of those words as a call to arms, a clarion call, or a call like the crowing of chanticleer waking his neighbors up.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Emerson wrote in the same essay that &#x201c;the ancient precept, &#x2018;Know thyself,&#x2019; and the modern precept, &#x2018;Study nature,&#x2019; become at last one maxim,&#x201d;21 the idea was substantiated that understanding nature was parallel to understanding yourself; that through a close examination of the exterior life you could discern the interior life. Thoreau would be able to put this principle into practice, merging self-examination and the study of nature into one act.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dozen years before Thoreau&#x2019;s Walden experiment, Emerson asked in his journal, &#x201c;But would it not be cowardly to flee out of society &amp; live in the woods?&#x201d;22 Thoreau&#x2019;s move, however, was no escape but only a temporary repositioning to adjust his angle of vision. The place from which one makes an observation is critical, as when he noted that the seashore of Cape Cod formed &#x201c;neutral ground, a most advantageous point from which to contemplate this world,&#x201d;23 or when he wrote in 1852 that the &#x201c;elevated position&#x201d; afforded by climbing a mountain allowed him to &#x201c;see an infinite variety far and near in their relation to each other, thus reduced to a single picture.&#x201d;24<br> &nbsp;<br> Walden Woods was not the place a Harvard graduate usually went to live. It had been home to former slaves, Irish immigrants working on the railroad, lurkers, alcoholics, and, in 1845, Henry David Thoreau. Unlike many of the others who resided in Walden Woods for whom it was less a matter of choice than necessity, Thoreau&#x2019;s move to the woods &#x201c;to live deliberately&#x201d;25 was a matter of consideration, aspiration, and, ultimately, consequence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau&#x2019;s going to Walden Pond was in part a personal, although not necessarily a private, response to the challenges suggested to him by the utopian communities springing up in the early 1840s, and in particular the two with which some of his friends were closely associated: Fruitlands and Brook Farm. George Ripley, one of the founders of Brook Farm, explained that they were trying to prepare &#x201c;a society of liberal, intelligent, and cultivated persons, whose relations with each other would permit a more simple and wholesome life, than can be led amidst the pressure of our competitive institutions.... If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age.&#x201d;26<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau conducted the same experiments in living as these communities, but did so on a smaller scale and from a different direction. He was not trying to re-create society by reinventing how a community should work or by imposing a new constitution upon a self-created communal association, as Brook Farm had done. This was not the way society would be renewed. The failure of these and other similar efforts to fundamentally change the way people lived showed that Thoreau was correct in searching for another method to reform human culture.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Walden Pond Thoreau could question the individual&#x2019;s role and obligations, not only to society but to himself: how should he live, how should he interact with his neighbors, how should he obligate himself to the laws, not only of the society within which he lived, but to those laws that were higher than those of the land: moral or religious principles, or laws of conscience, that take precedence over the constitutions or statutes of society. These questions were paramount.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thoreau wrote in his journal, and repeated in his first book,&nbsp;<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>, that autobiography is preferable to biography: &#x201c;If I am not I, who will be?&#x201d;27 Or again, in his journal: &#x201c;Is not the poet bound to write his own biography? Is there any other work for him but a good journal? We do not wish to know how his imaginary hero, but how he, the actual hero, lived from day to day.&#x201d;28 It was the poet&#x2019;s business, he wrote, to be &#x201c;continually watching the moods of his mind, as the astronomer watches the aspects of the heavens. What might we not expect from a long life faithfully spent in this wise?...As travellers go around the world and report natural objects and phenomena, so faithfully let another stay at home and report the phenomena of his own life.&#x201d;29<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Garden of Evil (A Jim Rook Horror Novel, 8)</h2><p>Jim Rook, remedial English teacher and psychic, knows it&#x2019;s going to be a bad day.

One answer leads to more questions, which, in turn, demand more explanations. Still, she reflects herself in our personal and collective lives and gives intimations of her most essential meaning through images, myths, dreams, and fantasies. If we are willing to receive and be open to such phenomena, we might not only learn what she could represent, but we could also experience the healing force she embodies in our time. Throughout history, this darker aspect of the feminine has been both feared and sought after, both hated and admired. The Black Madonna of Einsiedeln stands among the many Black Virgins that seem to imagistically express this dark side of the feminine in a creative transformational manner for both the individual and the collective. Beginning with a history of the Einsiedeln Madonna, Dr. Gustafson broadens his analysis into a psychological and historical examination of the Black Madonna, from her roots in the pagan deity Lilith and the archetype of the Great Mother, to her resurgence as the Virgin in the Middle Ages, to her life today as the unheeded, unconscious archetype of the feminine.</p><p>:Fred Gustafson, contributing author of Betwixt and Between, lectures widely and has a full practice as both analytical psychologist and pastoral counselor.

Ridley Scott's film <i>Blade Runner</i> took a lot from it, and threw a lot away. Wonderful in itself, the film is a flash thriller, whereas Dick's novel is a sober meditation. As we all know, bounty hunter Rick Deckard is stalking a group of androids who have returned from space with short life spans and murder on their minds--where Scott's Deckard was Harrison Ford, Dick's is a financially strapped municipal employee with bills to pay and a depressed wife. In a world where most animals have died, and pet keeping is a social duty, he can only afford a robot imitation, unless he gets a big financial break. <p>The genetically warped "chickenhead" John Isidore has visions of a tomb-world where entropy has finally won.

During this period, General Dwight David Eisenhower, as Supreme Allied Commander, took control of all American, British, and Canadian air units and employed them for tactical and operational purposes over France rather than as a strategic force to attack targets deep in Germany. Using bombers as his long-range artillery, he directed the destruction of bridges, rail centers, ports, military installations, and even French towns with the intent of preventing German reinforcements from interfering with Operation Neptune, the Allied landings on the Normandy beaches. Ultimately, this air offensive resulted in the death of over 60,000 French civilians and an immense amount of damage to towns, churches, buildings, and works of art. This intense bombing operation, conducted against a friendly occupied state, resulted in a swath of physical and human destruction across northwest France that is rarely discussed as part of the D-Day landings.</p><p>This book explores the relationship between ground and air operations and its effects on the French population. It examines the three broad groups that the air operations involved, the doctrine and equipment used by Allied air force leaders to implement Eisenhower's plans, and each of the eight major operations, called lines of effort, that coordinated the employment of the thousands of fighters, medium bombers, and heavy bombers that prowled the French skies that spring and summer of 1944. Each of these sections discusses the operation's purpose, conduct, and effects upon both the military and the civilian targets. Finally, the book explores the short and long-term effects of these operations and argues that this ignored narrative should be part of any history of the D-Day landings.</p></p><p>After twenty years of enlisted and commissioned service in the US Army, Stephen A. Bourque obtained his PhD at Georgia State University and taught history at several military and civilian schools and universities, including the School of Advanced Military Studies, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, where he is professor emeritus."The sacrifices of the D-Day Loperation overlord, whose 75th anniversary will be celebrated on Thursday, saw 60,000 French perished under allied bombs.Written by a specialist in military history, this book brings back the shadows of this terrible episode." --<i><b>Histoire</b></i><br><br>2018 <i><b>Military Times</b></i> Choice for Summer Reading Guide - https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/2018/06/21/seal-strength-girl-power-and-more-military-times-2018-summer-reading-guide/<br><br>"Passionate from start to finish, Bourque details the merciless flattening of the ancient cities of Rouen, Caen, Le Havre, Saint-Lo, and Boulogne-Sur-Mar for the sake of a ruse to keep the Nazis guessing.

Beyond the Beach provides a classic example of the importance of human agency on the conduct of warfare and how those of us who wish to achieve certain effects are often blind to the actual results of our operations.... [It] is a very informative work which raises many questions that are relevant today. This book is recommended for air enthusiasts and joint force commanders alike." --<b>Australian Naval Institute</b><br><br>"Beyond the Beach is very well written, expertly researched and, while written with passion, is well balanced. It challenges histories of D-Day that ignore the bombing campaigns - campaigns which contributed directly to the success of the landings and subsequent breakout of forces into France; and it confronts the reader, documenting the terrible casualties and immense damage wrought upon the French population by the bombing. The book is well-suited for students of the application of air power." --<i><b>United Service</b></i><br><br>"<i>Beyond the Beach</i> offers a haunting yet important narrative which will greatly interest readers of military history in general and World War II in particular. A great deal of controversy remains to this day concerning the air war over France, for just as Allied air operations took the lives of many French innocents, they significantly aided the American, British, and Canadian soldiers who would later land on the beaches of Normandy in the summer of 1944. Bourque ultimately concludes that there is no easy or incontrovertible way to remember the Allied air war over France--or any chapter of World War II, for that matter. For even history's most noble and necessary war was filled with the horror of blood, brutality, and butchery that reminds audiences old and new that no war is ever anything other than a tragedy." --<i><b>H-War</b></i><br><br>"The euphoria generated by the successful landings in Normandy, and the subsequent breakout from the beachheads, has largely glossed over the consequences and collateral damage in France. The author has provided a worthy evaluation of the costs, with the short term and long term effects - Most Highly Recommended." --<i><b>FIRE Project</b></i><br><br>"Beyond the Beach is an essential addition to our understanding of the battle for France, these deaths, generally glossed over as 'collateral damage,' profoundly shaped the French attitudes towards and understanding of the war." --<i><b>The Strategy Bridge</b></i><br><br>Bourque presents a well-balanced, thorough summation on the effectiveness of aerial bombardment. His emphasis on the neglected subject of French civilian casualties and collateral damage is thought-provoking and worthy of further study. As such, Beyond the Beach is a welcome addition to the study of the use of air power in support of ground operations.

The eldest of four children, she was raised by a father who helped her believe in herself, and by a mother who taught her a sense of the importance of virtues like self-respect, grace, and sacrifice. In her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi, within a tightly-knit community of neighbors and kin, Sela learned ways that would remain with her throughout life -- humble virtues that were "forged in the hearth of a loving home."</p><p> After graduating from the University of Alabama, Sela left the South in search of the excitement of cities like New York and Los Angeles, and the creative rewards of an acting career. But as she started her own family, she found herself pining for the comforts of her small-town childhood -- and searching for a way to balance her children's West Coast upbringing with a taste of a more natural way of life. She and her husband built a second home on a farm there, where she and her family could retreat several times each year, and became involved in several projects designed to restore the vitality of the hometown she remembered so fondly. Even as Sela was reconnecting with the rhythms of home, though, her world was rocked by a crisis the family had long anticipated but never quite prepared for -- the death of her mother. As her family gathered around her mama's bedside, Sela's simple journey home became something far deeper: a turning point in her own life, as she pondered her mother's complicated legacy, and came to terms with just what it was she herself was searching for.</p><p>Filled with warmth, storytelling, and laughter, <em>Homesick</em> is a book to treasure: an exploration of the lessons we carry away with us from childhood, and a celebration of the bittersweet legacy of home. </p></p><p><p>Sela Ward is the recipient of two Emmy awards for her work on <em>Once &amp; Again</em> and <em>Sisters</em>, and a Cable Ace Award for her role as Jessica Savitch in <em>Almost Golden.</em> She recently founded Hope Village for Children, a permanent home for abused and neglected children, in Meridian, Mississippi. Sela lives in Los Angeles, California, with her husband and their two children, and returns frequently with her family to her Mississippi hometown.</p>This earnest memoir by Ward, the 46-year-old star of the 1990s sitcom hits Sisters and Once &amp; Again and spokesperson for Sprint long distance, juxtaposes a jet-setting Hollywood image with a smalltown Mississippi past. More sugared up than a glass of Southern iced tea, the book will surely build Ward's reputation with her TV fan base, as it doesn't delve deep into Ward's psyche or tell all about the biz. It's targeted at the women Ward grew up with in Meridian, Miss. the same women she wants to reunite with now that she's returned there to begin settling down, loaded with cash, a Los Angeles venture capitalist husband and their two children. The fascinating trajectory of Ward's ideal American woman's life she went from cheerleader and homecoming queen at the University of Alabama to fashion model and fixture of New York nightlife should intrigue readers who can relate to culture shock. There's also a smattering of intelligently researched treatises on civil rights and on the contemporary crumbling of social bonds. A portion of the book's proceeds will go to a foundation for abused and neglected children that Ward founded last year in Meridian. Her overly saccharine tendencies notwithstanding, Ward gives readers a cute story of a smalltown girl's rise to celebrity.

It is the hottest summer of the sixteenth century. Shardlake is trying to keep a low profile, believing himself to be out of favour with Thomas Cromwell and trying to maintain his London-based legal practice. He has been pulled, against his better judgement, into defending Elizabeth Wentworth, charged with murdering her cousin. But Elizabeth refuses to plead either guilty or not guilty. As a result she will be crushed under weights until she pleads or dies. Shardlake is powerless to help the girl yet she is suddenly granted a reprieve - courtesy of Cromwell. The cost of the reprieve to Shardlake is two weeks once again in the service of Cromwell. Cromwell, however, is no longer the triumphant, irresistible force he once was, not least because of the ill-fated marriage he arranged for the King with Anne of Cleves. Cromwell is running out of options, but he has one more card to play: Greek Fire, an ancient weapon considered lost long ago, which has turned up again in the hands of two alchemist brothers. This is the kind of gift to guarantee the King&#39;s favour, it is also the kind of gift that people kill for. . .</p><p>C.J Sansom was educated at Birmingham University, where he took a BA then a Ph.D. in history. Greek Fire is his second novel, following on from his remarkable debut, Dissolution.Matthew Shardlake, the marvelous hunchbacked 16th-century attorney who first appeared in Sansom's <i>Dissolution</i>, returns in this spellbinding Tudor-era tale of murder, conspiracy and betrayal. Shardlake normally handles property cases and the occasional dangerous mission for Lord Thomas Cromwell, the king's high counselor. Now he is engaged to defend a young woman accused of a curious murder, and the case seems hopeless. The girl refuses to speak and, under English law, unless she offers a plea in court she will be slowly crushed to death. Cromwell offers Shardlake a two-week stay of execution if he will agree to undertake a secret mission. Desperate to save the girl's life, Shardlake agrees. Rumors abound of a new and terrifying weapon called Greek Fire, and Cromwell orders Shardlake to find it, along with its secret formula and the two alchemists who possess it. Before Shardlake can even speak to the alchemists, they are brutally murdered, the formula and Greek Fire go missing, and horror and death are unleashed. Fortunately, Shardlake is aided by Jack Barak, a capable rogue working for Cromwell, and his old friend, Guy Malton, a peculiar apothecary. Sansom's vivid portrayal of squalid, stinking, bustling London; the city's wealth and poverty; the brutality and righteousness of religious persecution; and the complexities of English law make this a suspenseful, colorful and compelling tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wishing to return to simplicity and honesty, Purcell and Elmslie created homes and buildings that were consistent with a democratic society-simple forms, the natural use of textural materials and decoration, and buildings that accommodated the nature of a site. As did Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, Purcell and Elmslie held the conviction that a building does not end with its simple structure, but reaches its final and logical culmination in the clothing-color, situation and natural environment, together with its decoration of glass, terra-cotta, and other textural materials. <br> The firm of Purcell and Elmslie was tremendously successful in the sense that their small open-planned free-flowing houses could be shared by a great number of Americans of moderate means. Projects discussed in this book can be found throughout the Midwest, including Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, North Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, and more. The time has come to recognize the work of these progressive architects of the Midwest. <br> Purcell and Elmslie: Prairie Progressives includes: <br> Comprehensive biographies of George Grant Elmslie and William Gray Purcell<br> The Work of the Firm<br> The Domestic and Non-Domestic Work of Purcell, Feick and Elmslie<br> Work after the Firm Broke Up<br> The Late Work of Purcell and Elmslie<br> A Catalog of Major Projects<br></p><p>Purcell&amp;Elmslie<br> Prairie Progressive Architects Organic, honesty, and democratic were the terms most often used by Prairie School architects in reference to their architecture. The new architecture of the early 1900s was in essence the culmination of a tendency toward indigenous expression that had been inherent in America since the seventeenth century.<br> The initiators of this progressive philosophy were Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, whose works and writings are the most widely known. In fact, they are so well known that there has been a tendency to dismiss the others who worked and produced in the same period as copyists or minor innovators. Such is far from the truth as the firm of William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie adequately indicates. They made significant contributions that were important not only in their own day but remain important in the fabric of our towns today. The most productive of the Prairie School firms of the time, Purcell and Elmslie included in all their thinking the conviction that a building does not end with its simple structure but reaches its final and logical culmination in the clothing-color, situation and natural environment together with its decoration of glass, terra-cotta and other textural materials.<br> The only book to contain details from the extensive office records of the firm of Purcell and Elmslie, as well as from letters, unpublished writings, notes and personal conversations with William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie, this comprehensive volume encompasses the history of the firm, from their residential designs such as the Purcell-Cutts House in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to commercial buildings such as the Merchants Bank in Winona, Minnesota, to civic buildings such as the Woodbury County Courthouse in Sioux City, Iowa.<br>"A sumptuous, informative volume that should be welcomed by all those who appreciate the Arts and Crafts Movement. This book will likely remain the standard source for its subject for years to come."<br> -Richard Longstreth, author of The Charnley House: Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Making of Chicago's Gold Coast.<br></p><h2>Truth in a Culture of Doubt: Engaging Skeptical Challenges to the Bible</h2><p>All too often Christians, and even Christian leaders, don&#x2019;t know how to deal with skeptical challenges of the Bible and the Christian faith. Few churches address the historical questions about the Bible and the theological questions concerning the God who, believers claim, has inspired the Bible. Too often Christian scholarship has been kept at arm&#x2019;s length and even viewed with suspicion by the church. Speaking and writing in this kind of environment, Bart Ehrman&#x2015;professor at UNC-Chapel Hill and author of four New York Times bestsellers&#x2015;has found a captive audience. Ehrman&#x2019;s popularity is due in large part to the fact that he is talking about things most people never learned about in church. Some have long given up on Christianity, and Ehrman is only reinforcing their decision to depart from their Christian upbringing. Others are trying to reconcile their faith with rational arguments and find Ehrman&#x2019;s books both interesting and disturbing if not appealing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>Truth in a Culture of Doubt</i> takes a closer look at the key arguments skeptical scholars such as Ehrman keep repeating in radio interviews, debates, and in his their popular writings. If you are looking for insightful responses to critical arguments from a biblical perspective, easily accessible and thoughtfully presented, this book is for you. This is the first book to provide a comprehensive response to Ehrman&#x2019;s popular works. It is presented in such a way that readers can either read straight through the book or use it as a reference when particular questions arise. Responding to skeptical scholars such as Ehrman, <i>Truth in a Culture of Doubt</i> takes readers on a journey to explain topics such as the Bible&#x2019;s origins, the copying of the Bible, alleged contradictions in Scripture, and the relationship between God and evil. Written for all serious students of Scripture, this book will enable you to know how to respond to a wide variety of critical arguments raised against the reliability of Scripture and the truthfulness of Christianity.</p><p><b>Andreas K�stenberger </b>(Ph.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) is senior research professor of New Testament and Biblical Theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Darrell Bock</b> (Ph.D., University of Aberdeen) is executive director of Cultural Engagement and senior research professor of New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Josh Chatraw </b>(Ph.D., Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) is the Pastor of Preaching and Students at First Baptist Church in Dublin, Georgia.</p><h2>Environmentalism and Economic Justice: Two Chicano Struggles in the Southwest (Society, Environment, and Place)</h2><p><b>Ecological causes are championed</b> not only by lobbyists or hikers. While mainstream environmentalism is usually characterized by well-financed, highly structured organizations operating on a national scale, campaigns for environmental justice are often fought by poor or minority communities. <i>Environmentalism and Economic Justice</i> is one of the first books devoted to Chicano environmental issues and is a study of U.S. environmentalism in transition as seen through the contributions of people of color. It elucidates the various forces driving and shaping two important examples of environmental organizing: the 1965-71 pesticide campaign of the United Farm Workers and a grazing conflict between a Hispano cooperative and mainstream environmentalists in northern New Mexico. The UFW example is one of workers highly marginalized by racism, whose struggle--as much for identity as for a union contract--resulted in boycotts of produce at the national level. The case of the grazing cooperative Ganados del Valle, which sought access to land set aside for elk hunting, represents a subaltern group fighting the elitism of natural resource policy in an effort to pursue a pastoral lifestyle. In both instances Pulido details the ways in which racism and economic subordination create subaltern communities, and shows how these groups use available resources to mobilize and improve their social, economic, and environmental conditions. <i>Environmentalism and Economic Justice</i> reveals that the environmental struggles of Chicano communities do not fit the mold of mainstream environmentalism, as they combine economic, identity, and quality-of-life issues. Examination of the forces that create and shape these grassroots movements clearly demonstrates that environmentalism needs to be sensitive to local issues, economically empowering, and respectful of ethnic and cultural diversity.</p><p>Environmentalism and Economic Justice spotlights another front in the ongoing wars over environmental issues, a front being fought by Chicano communities in the American Southwest. The book concentrates on struggles surrounding both the 1965-71 pesticide campaign of the United Farm Workers and a grazing conflict involving a Hispano cooperative and mainstream environmentalists in northern New Mexico. Within these stories, readers will find broader implications for understanding how minority groups are using available resources to mobilize and improve their social, economic, and environmental conditions.Laura Pulido is an assistant professor of geography at the University of Southern California.

Unable to maintain rule of law, the federal government now faces an opposition movement and the threat of civil war. Bishop and Terri are drawn into the struggle and have to risk everything to save both an old friend and the country they love.</p><p>From my perspective there is no more important asset for weathering life's storms than having a real partner - someone you know is with you. Holding Their Own II explores how Bishop and Terri adapt in a post-apocalyptic world where last month's pre-foreclosure notice is no longer a threat, but lawless vigilantes, desperate for food and other resources are. Can the human race survive without grocery stores, pharmacies, or hospitals? <br><br>Can America recover from this crushing blow? How would TEOTWAWKI impact our marriages, friends, loyalties, and judgment? How would we cope with decisions that put ourselves at risk versus the greater good of all? Would it truly be every man for himself? I enjoyed writing HTO II because it provides a medium for exploring these questions. There is no manual for partnership in a post-collapse world. I hope everyone enjoys Bishop and Terri's continued adventure.

They urged, therefore, that, without direct allusion to the manners of the Eastern tribes, and to the romantic conflicts of the period, the title of a "Tale of the Crusaders" would resemble the playbill, which is said to have announced the tragedy of Hamlet, the character of the Prince of Denmark being left out.

These stewards of American capitalism have insisted on the central and essential place of accumulated wealth through the booms, busts, and recessions of the last half century, giving rise to our current woes.<br><br>In telling the stories of these politicians, economists, and financiers who declared a moral battle for freedom but instead gave rise to an age of greed, Madrick traces the lineage of some of our nation&#x2019;s most pressing economic problems. He begins with Walter Wriston, head of what would become Citicorp, who led the battle against government regulation. He examines the ideas of economist Milton Friedman, who created the plan for an anti-Rooseveltian America; the politically expedient decisions of Richard Nixon that fueled inflation; the philosophy of Alan Greenspan, on whose libertarian ideology a house of cards was built on Wall Street; and the actions of Sandy Weill, who constructed the largest financial institution in the world, which would have gone bankrupt in 2008 without a federal bailout of $45 billion. Significant figures including Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, Jack Welch, and Ronald Reagan play key roles as well.<br><br>Intense economic inequity and instability is the story of our age, and Jeff Madrick tells it with style, clarity, and an unerring command of his subject.</p><p><b>Jeff Madrick</b> is a regular contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books,</i> a former economics columnist for <i>The New York Times,</i> and editor of <i>Challenge </i>magazine<i>.</i> He is an adjunct professor of humanities at The Cooper Union, and senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, The New School.

He lives in New York City.Chapter 1<br><br>Walter Wriston<br><br>Regulatory Revolt<br><br>As Ronald Reagan led his rebellion against government, a quieter one was born in the business community. Its leader was Walter Wriston, a tall, slouched, deeply intelligent and taciturn man with unusual ambition, little regard for tradition, and a highly conservative political ideology that he had inherited from his father. Wriston wanted to transform banking into a business like any other, capable of increasing profits as rapidly as the most admired companies in the nation. The goal would require undoing the federal financial regulations established during the Great Depression.<br><br>Walter Wriston was born in 1919 in Middletown, Connecticut, his father, Henry, an eminent history professor at the town's prestigious university, Wesleyan. When Walter was five, his father was named president of Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, where Walter grew up until he entered Wesleyan in 1937. Despite the Depression, the Wriston family remained comfortable during Walter's adolescence.<br><br>Henry Wriston's reputation rose in these years and he was named president of Brown University in 1936, from which perch he was able to preach against FDR and the New Deal, convinced that the programs would lead to a planned economy. His heroes included Adam Smith, who, despite the complexities in thinking of the Scottish philosopher, he saw largely as the father of the invisible hand and laissez-faire economic philosophy. He also deeply admired the British philosopher Herbert Spencer, who a century after Smith had become popular for what was later called social Darwinism. Spencer, who beginning in the 1850s was philosophically opposed to government intervention in markets, was the popular author of the notion that human poverty was natural because the "survival of the fittest" (a phrase Charles Darwin borrowed from him) was a law of nature.<br><br>At Wesleyan, Walter Wriston studied history, his father's field. He entered the Fletcher School at Tufts University, one of the nation's most prestigious schools of diplomacy, just outside Boston, to pursue a graduate degree in foreign affairs. Wriston was married to a coed he had met at Connecticut College by the time he graduated in 1942. He was drafted into the Navy in 1944 and sent overseas but did not see combat. He returned to the United States in 1946, one of hundreds of thousands of other soldiers wondering what to do with their lives-and whether the economy would slide back into depression.<br><br>Wriston said he did not want an academic career like his father's. "I knew I wouldn't do that because you'd have nothing but comparisons," he said. "My sister's an academic and a very good one. But I didn't want any part of that." Hostility toward his father surfaced when Henry remarried in 1947, only a year after his mother's death, at which point Walter stopped speaking to him.<br><br>Wriston at first had "very little" interest in business. It was his mother's doctor who suggested he go into banking. "If I stayed up all night, I couldn't think of anything more stupid to do," he said, but the bank "hadn't hired anyone new since 1933," and it badly needed recruits. Moreover, it was willing to pay salaries comparable to those in industry. So in 1946 he took a temporary job in New York with National City Bank, at that time a diminished version of its pre- Depression glory, when it had been the largest and most visible bank in the nation. He fully expected to leave in a year and return to his planned career in diplomacy.<br>When Wriston joined National City, banking was a stodgy and unimaginative business. Regulations had been imposed in the 1930s to prevent the excesses in finance that had buffeted America time and again. Overaggressive banks had been a serious national concern throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br><br>To attract savers, deposit-taking banks historically had to make good the promise to pay back a depositor's money at a moment's notice, which in the 1800s usually meant maintaining specie (gold and silver coins) against deposits and investing those deposits cautiously. The essence of banking was dependability. The banks redeemed deposits in specie when requested and some created paper currency they also would redeem in specie.<br><br>During good economics times ever more confident banks offered higher interest rates to attract depositors and made riskier loans to farmers and businesses at higher interest rates. They kept less in specie as reserves and paid back less in specie for their paper currencies, and the system of credit expanded rapidly to support speculation in agriculture and livestock, land itself, and countless new businesses. Regularly, speculative bubbles were created, then burst, and financial panic turned into severe recession. Banks went out of business by the hundreds, depositors lost money, and debtors went bankrupt-and, in the early years of the century, often to prison.<br><br>In its early years, the United States had had a national bank, the principal legacy of Alexander Hamilton (there had also been an earlier, informal national bank just after the Revolution), to restrain overspeculation, but it also tended to restrict lending to elite businesses and urban financiers. The bank's original charter was renewed under President James Madison in 1816 for another twenty years. But in 1836, President Andrew Jackson's veto ended the reign of the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson flamboyantly sided with the farmers and populists who believed the big Eastern bankers were corrupt and habitually made credit too scarce or expensive for them.<br><br>Jackson's anti-bank policies have been widely criticized by business historians, but the farmers were correct about often inadequate credit from the national bank for smaller borrowers. Looser banking standards did contribute to economic growth and the democratization of credit in these years. But a balance between adequate credit and overspeculation could not be reached. Big centralized banks favored elites, and overspeculation at smaller banks almost invariably had painful consequences, contributing to the uneven if occasionally exuberant growth of the nineteenth century.<br><br>In the wake of a devastating panic in 1907, the U.S. Federal Reserve was created in 1914 to avoid such unstable conditions. But the bankers who manned the new young central bank had neither the experience nor the will to do the job properly, and lacked some of the necessary authority. Flagrant abuse in the financial community was unchecked in the 1920s and the roaring stock market, supported by highly indebted speculators, burst in 1929. The real estate market, also supported by mammoth levels of debt, collapsed as well. By then, banks were not only making business and consumer loans in excess, but also selling stocks and bonds, running investment management companies, and creating new and highly speculative investment vehicles for individuals-as well as promoting their own stock prices.<br><br>Such a credit boom and bust alone may not have resulted in the Depression but it contributed substantially to its severity. Thousands of banks failed in the early 1930s as savers withdrew their funds, fearing that the banks had no assets with which to pay them-a classic bank run. By 1932, one fourth of all U.S. banks had failed, and state after state imposed a moratorium on banking. Franklin Roosevelt, on taking office as president in 1933, declared a bank holiday, closing the deposit and withdrawal windows around the country temporarily. Roosevelt resisted pleas to nationalize the banks, but he and his advisers established comprehensive new regulations. Under Roosevelt, the federal government created the Federal Deposit In-<br><br>surance Corporation (FDIC) to insure savers' deposits in case of bank failure, giving the government further oversight of member banks. The federal government also restrained overly risky investments with insured deposits by establishing limits on the interest banks could pay savers to attract their money (Regulation Q of the new law), and eliminating interest entirely on checking accounts. The fear was that competition for deposits would drive rates up and encourage banks to make more risky investments to earn higher returns.<br><br>FDR and members of Congress were determined to end the conflicts of interest of the financial institutions. If a commercial bank owned equity in a company, it had incentives to lend money to the company, disregarding the risk of the loans. There were natural incentives to provide biased information to stockbroker clients about companies in which the banks had investments or to whom they made loans. The Glass- Steagall Act of 1933, named after its congressional sponsors, Senator Carter Glass and Congressman Henry Bascom Steagall, legally separated commercial banks, which collected deposits and lent money, from investment banks and stockbrokers, who could own parts of companies, raise equity for clients, and advise investors on what investments to make. (The establishment of the FDIC and Regulation Q were parts of the legislation as well.)<br><br>Wriston's bank, National City, was, before the Depression, the largest bank in the world, and was an aggressive leader in many of the interdependent businesses that eventually caused so much trouble, including stockbrokerage. Its high-profile chairman, Charles Mitchell, was forced to resign in 1933 in the depths of the banking panic, but the bank survived. Under Glass-Steagall, National City, like other major banks, was required to divest itself of its brokerage and underwriting arms, and do business only as a commercial bank, accepting deposits and making conservative purchases of government securities or cautious loans to business. The prestigious J.P. Morgan bank, run by the most influential financier of the age, was also separated from its investment banking arm, which took the name Morgan Stanley. The investment banks and brokerage firms were now regulated by the newly created Securities and Exchange Commission, whose first chairman was Joseph P. Kennedy, an aggressive financie...</p><h2>Ten Little Ladybugs</h2><p>Young children will enjoy learning simple subtraction as they watch ten touchable ladybirds disappear one by one, with the turn of each page.</p><p></p><h2>Building &amp; Detailing Scale Model Ships: The Complete Guide to Building, Detailing, Scratchbuilding, and Modifying Scale Model Ships</h2><p>Shows how to turn an average ship model into a highly detailed masterpiece.

For what could be better than an evening at a Paris theatre? Who more famous than the evening&#x2019;s glittering star? Enter the magnificent Montfleury, stage right!<br>&nbsp;The mighty Montfleury had not spoken more than three lines when a voice even louder than his own came booming out of the auditorium: <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What? Has this thing appeared again tonight?&#x201d; The audience parted like the Red Sea, and there he stood: Cyrano had come after all. &#x201c;Montfleury, I thought I forbade you ever to set foot on stage again! You are the greatest ham since the Gadarene Swine. Be so good as to cart your streaky bacon off the stage and be gone!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Uproar. Half the audience began to moan and groan, not wanting to be robbed of the play they had come to see. The rest were just as happy to watch Cyrano rant against Bad Acting. Montfleury might be grossly huge and Cyrano as lean as a greyhound, but as celebrities went, Cyrano de Bergerac was by far the larger&#x2014;larger than Life, in fact. Montfleury flung his arms about and tried to begin again, but it was hopeless.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Call yourself an actor? The trees of Birnam Wood were less wooden in Macbeth! Will you leave the stage of your own accord or must I cut you up into logs and burn you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The actor&#x2019;s lines gurgled back down his throat like water down a drain. He could see the white panache on Cyrano&#x2019;s hat looming through the smoke of the footlights, and his two fat little legs told him to run.<br>&nbsp;The audience took sides: <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Get on with the play!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You tell him, Cyrano!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stand your ground, Montfleury!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Teach him a lesson, Cyrano!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;But the other actors were protesting on their own behalf. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s going to pay us if we pack up and go home?&#x201d; they wanted to know. They had no objection to Montfleury-the-Ham getting hamstrung, but they could not afford to lose an evening&#x2019;s pay. With a flourish worthy of royalty, Cyrano tossed back his cloak, reached across his body . . .<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s going for his sword!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;. . . and drew out a bulging purse. He tossed it onto the stage where it burst gloriously open, spilling golden coins across the boards and fetching an acrobatic display from the actors as they dived to gather it up. Applause and peals of laughter burst from the gallery: The play might be lost, but the gesture was too impossibly grand to resist. What a divine fool that Cyrano was! What a colossus of style!<br>&nbsp;Quel panache! <br>&nbsp;On the sill of a nearby opera box, however, the fingers of a black-gloved hand drummed irritably. &#x201c;The Gascon is making a nuisance of himself,&#x201d; said the Comte de Guiche, through a yawn of exquisite boredom. &#x201c;Do something about him.&#x201d; One of his retinue slipped out of the opera box and downstairs to the auditorium.<br>&nbsp;Cyrano had started to list, in verse, all the reasons for drowning bad actors in big buckets. But he had no sooner started than he was interrupted by a jeering, sneering heckler. <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this, then? Is Sir-run-nose poking his nose in again where it don&#x2019;t belong?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;The crowd gave a gasp. So! The evening&#x2019;s excitements were not over after all! A foppish young viscount lounged against the edge of the stage, flicking pieces of orange peel around the floor with the tip of his elegant sword, and smirking. &#x201c;And such an ugly nose, too,&#x201d; he tittered. <br>&nbsp;A spot of colour touched Cyrano&#x2019;s cheek and he glanced up fleetingly at the gallery. Five hundred pairs of eyes swung to see what he would do next. <br>&nbsp;After a long silence, even the fop cocked a puzzled eyebrow. &#x201c;Well? What are you waiting for? Aren&#x2019;t you going to cross swords with me? I insulted your big fat nose.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You did? When?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The fop was wrong-footed. &#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You call that an insult?&#x201d; Cyrano declaimed. &#x201c;Tch-tch-tch. I have trodden in worse insults than that on the pavement. My God, man! If you&#x2019;re going to insult me, at least do it with a little style! A little panache! Good Lord! There are as many schools of insult as there are tribes of Israel, and is that the best you can come up with? I see I must teach you the Art of the Insult!&#x201d; At last the sword came out&#x2014;a noise like a snake uncoiling. The onlookers shivered with delicious horror and drew back as far as possible, boys thrust behind their mothers, wives peeping over their husbands&#x2019; shoulders. Once more Cyrano&#x2019;s grey-brown eyes flickered toward the upper gallery of the theatre and he raised the hilt of his sword to his lips in salute to someone seated there. He did not remove his hat: Perhaps he knew that, from up there, its brim concealed his huge beak of a nose.<br>&nbsp;Then his blade flashed. Fast as the spoke of a carriage wheel it moved. Its reach was as long as a moonbeam. In his hand, it was summer lightning. His voice was calm and very slightly taunting. Such a silence had fallen that his words were audible from the front stalls to the upper gallery. <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;One! There is the Insult Theatrical. Let me give you an example: O brave New World that has such noses in it!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Two! There is the Insult Geographical: Just walking round you is like rounding Cape Horn!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Three! The Insult Inquisitive: Does it not cause you to tilt over, monsieur, or do you wear counterweights in your boots?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The crowd roared with laughter, while the fop roared with frustration, his lunges and parries hitting nothing but the empty air as Cyrano stepped deftly round him.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Four! There is the Insult Punning: Where does Cyrano come to an end? Nobody nose!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Five! The Insult Explanatory: Don&#x2019;t tell me! You grew it that big to keep your feet from getting sunburnt!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Six! The Insult Medical: When you have a cold, monsieur, Belgium floods!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Seven! The Insult Biblical: It wasn&#x2019;t Ararat where Noah ran aground, you know!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;By this time, the gallant had forgotten about sarcastic remarks or showing off or even fencing. He had simply begun to run, lifting his heels higher than his kneecaps as Cyrano carved him clear of the floor.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You might have attempted Eight! The Insult Exaggeration: Have a care! When you sneeze, whole fleets sink in the Spanish Main!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Or Nine! The Insult Unsporting: You must be the only man who can win a race by a nose before the starter has even fired his gun!<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Or Ten! The Insult Sentimental: Aaah! How kind of you, monsieur, to provide a perch for so many ickle squiwwels and birdies!&nbsp;&#x201c;And now&#x2014;to make an end&#x2014;the Insult Well-Intentioned: If you ever lose your scabbard, at least you will always have somewhere to sheath your . . .&#x201d; One small flick of his wrist, and Cyrano whipped the foil from his opponent&#x2019;s hand and sent it skidding among the floor rushes. &#x201c;. . . sword. But no! You aspired to none of these! The words you offered me were about as witty as a dead rat, as clever as a used handkerchief, as original as Thursday!&#x201d; He leaned forward, as if to dislodge a fly from a cake, and the viscount cowered down, eyes shut, trying to shield the whole of his body with two thin arms. &#x201c;So, by your leave, I think I shall not put myself to the trouble of actually fighting you, monsieur.&#x201d; He added coldly: &#x201c;The real shame rests with whoever sent you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Then Cyrano plunged his sword back into its sheath, leaving the fop gibbering and half-naked amid the rags of his shredded clothing. As the man scrambled and tripped his way out onto the street, he could scarcely believe his luck at getting away alive and unscathed. He wiped his face with relief&#x2014;and found that the tip of his nose was dripping blood delicately onto his lacy shirt. He had been too scared even to feel the nick.<br>&nbsp;Turning to acknowledge the cheers, Cyrano&#x2019;s grey-brown eyes glanced upward once more and rested for a fleeting moment on the face in the gallery. His beautiful young cousin reproached him with a shake of her head, but even she could not help smiling at his spectacular, idiotic coup de th��tre. Then, in the swish of a silken gown, she was gone, and it was as if one of the great multitiered chandeliers had blown out in the draught.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well! Have you made enough enemies for one night?&#x201d; said Cyrano&#x2019;s friend le Bret. &#x201c;One: Montfleury. Two: the owner of the theatre. Three: that little viscount you shredded. Four . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;In that case, my cup runneth over with happiness!&#x201d; said Cyrano ferociously. &#x201c;Everywhere I go, arrogant little jackanapes jump out of the woodwork hoping to get famous by beating Cyrano de Bergerac in a duel. It is tedious in the extreme.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You idiot, Cyrano. You&#x2019;ll never get rich if you <br>go about chopping up members of the nobility! And talking of money . . . that was a year&#x2019;s pay you threw on stage. What are you going to live on now?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll manage,&#x201d; said Cyrano with a shrug. &#x201c;Sometimes one single moment is worth a year&#x2019;s pay!

It has seen houses fly and cattle soar. When funnel clouds walk through the wheat, big hail falls behind. As the biggest stones melt, turtles and mice and fish and even men can be seen frozen inside. And Kansas is not surprised.<br><br>Henry York had seen things in Kansas, things he didn&#x2019;t think belonged in this world. Things that didn&#x2019;t. Kansas hadn&#x2019;t flinched.<br><br>The soles of Henry&#x2019;s shoes were twenty feet off the ground. He had managed to slide open the heavy door in the barn loft, and after brushing the rust and flakes of red paint off his hands, he&#x2019;d seated himself on the dust-covered planks and looked out over the ripening fields. Henry&#x2019;s feet dangled, but Kansas sprawled.<br><br>Henry had changed in the short weeks since he&#x2019;d stepped off the bus from Boston, been smothered by Aunt Dotty and taken to the old farmhouse, to the attic&#x2014;to a new existence. He looked different, too, and it wasn&#x2019;t just the cut across the backs of his fingers. That was scarring worse than it needed to only because he couldn&#x2019;t stop himself from picking at it. The burns on his jaw were a lot more noticeable and had begun scarring as well. He didn&#x2019;t like touching them. But he had to. Especially the one below his ear. It was turning into a divot as wide as his fingertip.<br><br>What had changed most about Henry York was inside his head. Things he had always known no longer seemed true. A world that had always felt like a slow and stable and even boring machine had suddenly come to life. And it was far from tame. He&#x2019;d uncovered a wall of doors in his attic room, and now he didn&#x2019;t know who he was. He didn&#x2019;t know who his real parents were or whether he was even in the right world. He didn&#x2019;t really know anything. Strangely, that was more comfortable than thinking that he did.<br><br>One month before, fresh off the bus from Boston, he would have been nervous sitting where he was, slowly bouncing his heels on the wall of the barn. One month before, he wouldn&#x2019;t have believed that he could hit a baseball. Something wheezed beside him, and Henry turned. One month before, the world was still normal, and creatures like this one didn&#x2019;t exist.<br><br>The raggant sniffed loudly and settled onto his haunches. His wings were tucked back against his rough charcoal skin and his blunt horn was, as always, lifted in the air.<br><br>Henry smiled. He always did when he looked at the animal. It was so proud and so very unaware of how it looked. At least Henry thought it had to be. Shaped like a small basset hound but wearing wings and a rhino&#x2019;s face and skin, it was far from beautiful, but that didn&#x2019;t stop it from being as proud and stubborn as a peacock. Like an otherworldly bloodhound, it had found Henry, cracking the plaster in the attic wall from inside a cupboard. The raggant had started everything. Whoever it was that had sent the raggant had started everything. Henry couldn&#x2019;t even imagine who that might be.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know how strange you look?&#x201d; Henry asked, and he reached over and grabbed the loose skin on the creature&#x2019;s neck. It felt like sand-based dough, and as he squeezed, the raggant closed its black eyes and a low moan sputtered in its chest.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to see you fly,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;You know I will.&#x201d; He glanced down at the ground and then back at the raggant. He could push it. Then it would have to fly. But it just might be proud enough not to, proud enough to tuck its wings tight and bounce in the tall grass. &#x201c;Sometime,&#x201d; Henry said.<br><br>The afternoon sun was falling, and Henry knew it wouldn&#x2019;t be long before the barn&#x2019;s shadow stretched across acres. Worse, it wouldn&#x2019;t be long before the fields and the barn and all of Kansas became part of his past. His parents had been back from their ill-fated bicycle trip for a while, and he still hadn&#x2019;t heard from them. That wasn&#x2019;t too unusual. When they were just getting back from their photographed adventures, he rarely ever heard from them. The fact that they&#x2019;d actually managed to get kidnapped this time would make their return crazier, would keep him safely off their minds for that much longer. But it couldn&#x2019;t last. If they&#x2019;d had any say in the matter, he never would have been sent to stay with his cousins at all. Now that they&#x2019;d returned, they wouldn&#x2019;t leave him in Kansas for school or even through the summer. He&#x2019;d be back in Boston, on some new vitamin diet and meeting a new nanny, and then back to boarding school. Maybe a new one. His third.<br><br>Parents. He still thought of them that way. Would they ever have told him that Grandfather had found him in the attic? Not likely. Henry didn&#x2019;t care that he&#x2019;d been adopted. But it was hard not to care that his parents had never really been parents&#x2014;not like Uncle Frank and Aunt Dotty were to his cousins. Henry had always known exactly where he was on his parents&#x2019; list of priorities.<br><br>Yesterday, he&#x2019;d seen his parents on television. He&#x2019;d been stirring his cereal and listening to his youngest cousin, Anastasia, complain about Richard when Uncle Frank called him. He&#x2019;d hurried, and when he stepped into the room, Frank pointed. There, on a stiff couch in a television studio somewhere, sat Phillip and Ursula, smiling and nodding. They each had hands crossed on their knees. Ursula kept glancing at the camera. She looked like Henry&#x2019;s aunt Dotty, but with all her edges hardened. The two of them talked about their amazing endurance, the difficulty of bicycling through the Andes, how they had never given up hope of finishing their trek even after being abducted in Colombia, the size of their book deal, and their discussions with film agents.<br><br>In a general way, Henry remembered all they had said. But there were two things that sat in the front of his mind, every syllable in concrete.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you closer now?&#x201d; the woman had asked them. &#x201c;After going through all of this together?&#x201d;<br><br>Ursula had leaned forward. Phillip had leaned back. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Ursula had said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve both changed a great deal during this whole process. We really need to get to know each other again. But first we need to get to know ourselves.&#x201d;<br><br>Phillip had nodded.<br><br>Henry was pretty sure he knew what that meant.<br><br>And then the woman had asked about him.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Chocolate Bar</h2><p>From the creators of Chocolate Bar, New York City's candy store for grown-ups, comes <i>Chocolate Bar</i> a delicious ode to the sweet that entrances so many, with more than 30 recipes from such stellar chocolatiers as Jacques Torres and Andrew Shotts.

" &#x2015;Renaissance Studies</p><p>"In lively prose... the author paints a complex multilayered image of compelling vividness." &#x2015;History of European Ideas</p><p>A distinctively Roman Renaissance starting in the middle of the fifteenth century is the subject of Charles Stinger&#x2019;s celebrated study. Cultural history at its best, The Renaissance in Rome will inform both Renaissance and Reformation scholars, as well as general readers fascinated and affected by the Eternal City.</p></p><p>At the beginning of the 15th century, Rome proclaimed itself, as it had done throughout its history, <i>caput mundi</i>, "the head of the world." The truth, writes Charles Stinger, was less glorious: the popes had long since abandoned Rome for palaces in French Avignon, and the principal trading centers were in places such as Alexandria, Marseilles, and Constantinople. Even within Italy (which was still ununified), Florence and Venice were more important culturally. With the Renaissance, however, as European elites became interested in studying and emulating the ancient past, Rome became a great center anew: the popes returned, and travelers from around the world came to see the ruins of ancient times and to converse with intellectuals and artists. The transition, Stinger writes, was "from medieval alley and tower to Renaissance street and palace," from a closed and suspicious urban village to an open and vibrant city. With a cast of characters including Lorenzo de Medici, Michelangelo, and Lucrezia Borgia, Stinger relates a fascinating story of the city's renewal--which involved no small amount of intrigue. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Winner, American Historical Association Marraro Prize 1985</p><h2>Entombed (Alexandra Cooper)</h2><p>Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor Alexandra Cooper works to uncover a link between a serial killer and a body that has been discovered in a nineteenth-century brownstone formerly belonging to Edgar Allan Poe. By the author of The Kills. 175,000 first printing.</p><p>Series heroine Alexandra Cooper, head of Manhattan's sex crimes unit, returns in a novel that might have been titled "Nevermore,": focused as it is on the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe. When the body of a two-decades-old skeleton is found bricked up behind a wall in a soon-to-be-demolished building where Poe once lived, it looks like a very cold case indeed. But then that old murder is linked to a more current slaying, one that at first looks like the work of the Silk Stocking Rapist, Alex's old enemy, who terrorized the upper East Side of Manhattan several years ago but hasn't been heard from since. As usual, Alex and her good friends, detectives Mercer Wallace and Mike Chapman, take the reader to an area of New York most tourists never see--in this case, the Bronx Botanical Gardens and its wild, forested environs--and bring it dramatically to life. Just in case Poe ever has his own category on Alex's favorite TV show, there&#x2019;s enough trivia included about the master of the macabre's life and work to propel any reader to Final Jeopardy. <i>Entombed</i> is a smart, stylish, well-told tale. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Linda Fairstein was chief of the Sex Crimes Unit of the district attorney&#x2019;s office in Manhattan for more than two decades and is America&#x2019;s foremost legal expert on sexual assault and domestic violence.

Thompson and Errol Morris, Bruce Robinson offers a radical reinterpretation of Jack the Ripper, contending that he was not the madman of common legend, but the vile manifestation of the Victorian Age's moral bankruptcy.</p><p>In exploring the case of Jack the Ripper, Robison goes beyond the who that has obsessed countless others and focuses on the why. He asserts that any "gentlemen" that walked above the fetid gutters of London, the nineteenth century's most depraved city, often harbored proclivities both violent and taboo&#x2014;yearnings that went entirely unpunished, especially if he also bore royal connections. The story of Jack the Ripper hinges on accounts that were printed and distributed throughout history by the same murderous miscreants who frequented the East End of her Majesty's London, wiping the fetid muck from their boots when they once again reached the marble floors of society's finest homes.</p><p>Supported by primary sources and illustrated with 75 to 100 black and white photographs, this breathtaking work of cultural history dismisses the theories of previous "Ripperologists." A Robinson persuasively makes clear with his unique brilliance, The Ripper was far from a poor resident of Whitechapel . . . he was a way of life.</p></p><p><p>For over a hundred years, the mystery of Jack the Ripper has been a source of unparalleled fascination and horror, spawning an army of obsessive theorists and endless volumes purporting to finally reveal the identity of the brutal murderer who terrorized Victorian England.</p><p>But what if there was never really any mystery at all? What if the Ripper was always hiding in plain sight, deliberately leaving a trail of clues to his identity for anyone who cared to look, while cynically mocking those who were supposedly attempting to bring him to justice?</p><p>In <em>They All Love Jack</em>, the award-winning film director and screenwriter Bruce Robinson exposes the cover-up that enabled one of history's most notorious serial killers to remain at large. More than twelve years in the writing, this is no mere radical reinterpretation of the Jack the Ripper legend and an enthralling hunt for the killer. A literary high-wire act reminiscent of Tom Wolfe or Hunter S. Thompson, it is an expressionistic journey through the cesspools of late-Victorian society, a phantasmagoria of highly placed villains, hypocrites, and institutionalized corruption.</p><p>Polemic forensic investigation and panoramic portrait of an age, underpinned by deep scholarship and delivered in Robinson's inimitably vivid and scabrous prose, <em>They All Love Jack</em> is an absolutely riveting and unique book, demolishing the theories of generations of self-appointed experts&#x2014;the so-called Ripperologists&#x2014;to make clear, at last, who <em>really</em> did it; and, more important, how he managed to get away with it for so long.</p><p>Bruce Robinson is the director and screenwriter of <em>Withnail &amp; I</em>, <em>How to Get Ahead in Advertising</em>, <em>Jennifer 8</em>, and <em>The Rum Diary</em>. He has also written the screenplays for <em>The Killing Fields</em>, <em>Shadow Makers</em> (released in the US as <em>Fat Man and Little Boy</em>), <em>Return to Paradise</em>, and <em>In Dreams</em>.

He lives in London.</p></p><h2>The Practical Qabalah</h2><p>This is an excellent introduction to the Western Mystery Tradition and the symbolism of the Qabalah. Discusses pathworking procedures of Qabalah in light of the archetypes of Jungian psychology, showing how to work with dreams and visualization to help better communicate with yourself and others.</p><p></p><h2>The Butterfly&#39;s Way: Voices from the Haitian Dyaspora in the United States</h2><p>In five sections&#x2014;Childhood, Migration, Half/First Generation, Return, and Future&#x2014;the thirty-three contributors to this anthology write movingly, often hauntingly, of their lives in Haiti and the United States. Their <i>dyaspora</i>, much like a butterfly's fluctuating path, is a shifting landscape in which there is much travel between two worlds, between their place of origin and their adopted land.<br><br>This compilation of essays and poetry brings together Haitian-Americans of different generations and backgrounds, linking the voices for whom English is a first language and others whose dreams will always be in French and <i>Krey�l</i>. Community activists, scholars, visual artists and filmmakers join renowned journalists, poets, novelists and memoirists to produce a poignant portrayal of lives in transition.<br><br>Edwidge Danticat, in her powerful introduction, pays tribute to Jean Dominique, a sometime participant in the Haitian <i>dyaspora</i> and a recent martyr to Haiti's troubled politics, and the many members of the <i>dyaspora</i> who refused to be silenced. Their stories confidently and passionately illustrate the joys and heartaches, hopes and aspirations of a relatively new group of immigrants belonging to two countries that have each at times maligned and embraced them.</p><p><p>Edwidge Danticat is the author of numerous books, including <i>Brother, I&#x2019;m Dying</i>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was a National Book Award finalist; <i>Breath, Eyes, Memory</i>, an Oprah Book Club selection; <i>Krik? Krak!</i>, a National Book Award finalist; <i>The Dew Breaker</i>, winner of the inaugural Story Prize; and <i>The Farming of Bones</i>, which won an American Book Award for fiction in 1999. The recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, she has been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and elsewhere.</p>The experience of Haitian ?migr?s in what novelist Danticat (Krik? Krak!; etc.) calls the "tenth" geographical "department" of HaitiA"the floating homeland, the ideological one, which joined all Haitians living in the dyaspora"Ais the theme of this collection of 33 spare and evocative essays and poems. Most of these writers fled political instability as children and describe the dual reality of alienation from yetbelonging to two worlds, forging an identity separate from that of their parents in the new country, while at the same time continuing to wait for stability in the old country. Nik?l Payen tells of her experience as a U.S. Justice Department-sponsored interpreter who uses her knowledge of Krey?l ("the language whose purpose in life up until now had been to pain and confuse me") as "an asset" to translate for refugees waiting in horrific conditions at Guantanamo Naval Base following the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. When she witnesses the return of some of these HaitiansAdenied entrance to the U.S.Ashe likens their journey to the African Middle Passage. In another, Marie-H?l?ne Laforest, whose lighter skin color and family's wealth made her "white" in Haiti, realizes that she is simply black in America and later forges a third identity in Italy. Francie Latour, a journalist, convinces her American newspaper to send her to Haiti with a noble aim, but ends up "hitting a cultural wall" and being viewed as a "traitor" by her native people. This rich collection of writings will appeal to the growing number of Haitian-Americans and others interested in the question of the ?migr?'s sense of identity.

In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>James Lovelock is the author of more than 200 scientific papers and the originator of the Gaia Hypothesis (now Gaia Theory). He has written three books on the subject: Gaia: a new look at life on Earth; The Ages of Gaia; Gaia: the practical science of planetary medicine; and an autobiography, Homage to Gaia. He has received many honorary degrees as well as being made Companion of Honour by the Queen in 2003. He has held posts at numerous universities both in the UK and the US and since 1994 has been an Honorary Visiting Fellow of Green College, University of Oxford.<i>Starred Review.</i> The end is all but nigh for Mother Earth's inhabitants unless drastic measures are soon taken: that's the rueful prognostication delivered by Lovelock (<i>Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth</i>), intuitive originator of the theory that the world is a self-regulating system that, over the eons, has been able to sustain an equilibrium between hot and cold so as to support life. Now, propelled by global warming, Lovelock says, a tipping point has almost been reached beyond which the Earth will not recover sufficiently to sustain human life comfortably. Lovelock dismisses biomass fuels, wind farms, solar energy and fuel cell innovations as technologies unlikely to mitigate greenhouse gases in time to save the planet. Instead he sees nuclear energy as the only energy source that can meet our needs in time to prevent catastrophe. Chernobyl was a calamity, he notes, but nuclear power's danger is "insignificant compared with the real threat of intolerable and lethal heatwaves" and rising sea levels that could "threaten every coastal city of the world."

Each aspect of Robert MacNeil's youthful existence prompted yet another linguistic thrill. Childhood churchgoing "did not provide me with any spiritual awakening ... but it anointed me with language." His mother's passion for the natural world and his father's life as a ship's skipper gave him two more complete vocabularies. And "If you define yourself by the language you acquire as you enter different spheres," MacNeil writes, the absurd language of "cricket was another piece of my self-definition." <p> MacNeil is best known as a novelist, coauthor of <i>The Story of English</i>, and onetime executive editor of the <i>MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</i>. In <i>Wordstruck</i> he imparts a passion for Shakespeare (in particular, <i>Hamlet</i>), Dylan Thomas, and T. S. Eliot, whose ear for the English language, he says, was "the equivalent of perfect pitch--for the harmonic range of our tongue, its rhythms, and all its voices." <i>Wordstruck</i> is a charming memoir from a man "crazy about the sound of words, the look of words, the taste of words, the feeling for words on the tongue and in the mind."</p>MacNeil is best known as the executive editor of the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , but he is also an author of note (e.g., with Robert McCrum and others, he wrote The Story of English, LJ 8/86; and he was editor of The Way We Were: 1963, The Year Kennedy Was Shot , LJ 11/1/88). This second memoir captures his love affair with the English language, which he traces to the music of his Canadian mother's voice as she read aloud to him from the King James Bible and to the imaginary vistas unlocked by disembodied words on the radio. Along the way, he rediscovers his delight in numerous authors, including Chaucer, and shares his pleasure with offbeat phrases. Finally, he worries that the currency of language is being cheapened and offers solutions to the problem. Lively, reflective, and well written. Recommended.<br><i>- Linda L.

One bra, white, trimmed with lace. Three photographs of my cousins and sister; one picture of my parents; two of Babs and me hugging, the first on the field and the other one at a pub. One photograph of Sean, taken out again. Also taken out: one worn, stuffed dog called Tobo. In, reluctantly&#x2014;marmalade, because my mother wanted me to. Antibacterial soap, also at her insistence. My passport, of course. Three lipsticks. Seven pairs of underwear, all black. (I&#x2019;d switched to black at thirteen under the instruction of my sister in order to hide stains.) Ibuprofen. Condoms, just in case, knicked from the uni health center. One copy of <i>Ripley Under Ground</i>, by Patricia Highsmith. One copy of <i>Italy, Go!</i>, highlighted and marked. The suitcase itself, a large Samsonite with wheels, inherited from my father when he moved to Dublin.</p> <p>This case was eventually returned to my father by the authorities. It came back empty, save the marmalade, which never made it out of an inner pocket and was still carefully wrapped in a pair of clean running socks, blue.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>I was a girl from Ireland, gone to Italy to study abroad. The country I chose for the language, the city I chose by chance. A boy I knew a little told me Grifonia was a good place for students. Much smaller than Rome, but not boring. Safer for girls than Florence. Good chocolate, a big uni.</p> <p>&#x201c;And there are those parties,&#x201d; he said, as if I should know what he meant.</p> <p>My first afternoon, I wandered up to the main square and sat on the steps of the cathedral. I brought a guidebook, but I was too tired from the train ride to look anything up. The square was crowded with students and foreigners. I had never seen so many kids my age in one place, just doing nothing. They leaned against the warm stone, drinking and smoking, comparing photos from home. I tried to eavesdrop on the Italians, though unsuccessfully, then pretended to read, so as not to look too lonely.</p> <p>A few steps down, a girl with hair dyed lavender, half of it slipping out of a braid. She was kissing a boy. He seemed Italian, his skin dark, his hair short. He was heavy, carefully dressed in a cheap shirt, ironed, perhaps, by his mother, his brown wrists thick and covered in fur. He whispered in the girl&#x2019;s ear, and she leaned over and laughed.</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I knew what the hell you were saying,&#x201d; she said in English, and then giggled and kissed him again, more insistently this time.</p> <p>I felt strange watching from so close, but in fairness, I had been there first, and besides, the two seemed not to care. I tried to pay attention to my book, but I couldn&#x2019;t help it&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking.</p> <p>The boy&#x2019;s hands traveled over the girl&#x2019;s shirt, then under. Still kissing, the girl turned slightly and seemed to smile at me slyly, as if we were sharing a secret. I blinked, looked away, then back again. Yes, she was, in fact, grinning at me. A sign, somehow? Or was she just laughing?</p> <p>I stood, disoriented, my book and open purse falling to the ground.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, let me help you with your stuff,&#x201d; the girl said, leaping up. She was next to me now. The boy peered over, irritated. Apart, their incongruity grew. Her: shabby and a bit tough, yet possessing a silvery, enviable loveliness. Him: the sort of lump no one will go near at a dance.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, no. Thank you.&#x201d; I crouched and gathered my things. She shrugged and went back to the boy. Without turning again, I hurried away.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>When I first arrived in this small town in Umbria, I was childishly disappointed. I&#x2019;d imagined charming villas&#x2014;wide, gardened boulevards lined with flowers, the permeating smell of pastries and fresh bread. Instead: walls of stone emblazoned with graffiti, a scarcity of trees. Men with dark eyes slipped through Grifonia&#x2019;s medieval alleys, muttering words I couldn&#x2019;t catch. As a newcomer, I felt clumsy and mute. Having studied Italian for three years now, I was, at least according to my university instructors, almost fluent. Yet in the beginning I was too afraid to use any of it. Mostly, I moved about silent, flattening against walls in shops and restaurants, trying to make myself as invisible as possible.</p> <p>Soon enough, though, I fell into a pleasant, lazy rhythm. I had a glass of wine at ten a.m. in an overpriced caf�, watching the tourist families squabble by. I ate gelato twice a day and tried on handmade shirts I could never afford. One afternoon, I even sat in the cathedral for three-quarters of an hour, trying to drum up some inkling of faith, which, for the daughter of a Jew and an on-again off-again member of the Catholic Church, failed to make itself known.</p> <p>Yet I was a terminally responsible person, and this sort of loafing could not go on for long. I had classes to sign up for and, more immediately, living arrangements to make. The program had provided an initial stay in a clean if charmless rooming house near the train station, but my patience with the twenty-minute hike to the city center was waning. And so my third morning in Grifonia, I went to the bulletin board at the college and, using my new cell phone, called a few numbers pinned there on scraps of paper, hanging as precariously as the frayed threads of a tattered dress.</p> <p>During the course of the next day, I saw four flats. Having enjoyed a fairly large on-campus apartment back in Nottingham, I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for what passes for sizable in Italy. I had refrained from signing up for the Enteria housing out of allegiance to this idea I had of my new independence. The <i>other girls</i> might live in that sterile residence for foreigners, I&#x2019;d boasted to Babs, my best friend back home, but I was going to live with <i>real</i> Italians. Now I was wishing I&#x2019;d just filled out the damned form and split a flat with some nice girl from Glasgow. Two of the places required room sharing, which, after a couple of years of privacy, I just couldn&#x2019;t do. Another &#x201c;four-bedroom&#x201d; (there was a sagging cot in the kitchen) housed five somewhat angry-looking cats. One place looked promising and clean enough from the hallway, but when the door opened I was greeted by a stout, middle-aged woman who kept me prisoner for an hour and a half, instructing me, among other things, on where to buy the best sponges for scrubbing &#x201c;our&#x201d; floor.</p> <p>The next morning I woke dejected with only two numbers left in my notebook. I called the first and hacked through an awkward conversation with a woman who called herself Gia, then agreed with little hope to meet in front of the university. If these two were dead ends, I told myself, I&#x2019;d just go to the Enteria office. Surely someone had canceled their semester, and perhaps, with a little arranging, I could just move in with some other English-speakers after all.</p> <p>Within an hour, I found myself following a ropey woman with friendly eyes and platinum hair across a dirty brown square near the entrance of the school. Grifonia&#x2019;s center is comprised of a maze of alleyways and tiny passages that flit back and forth between ancient buildings; places that once were mere cow trails have centuries later become crowded streets. Even though the cottage couldn&#x2019;t have been more than five hundred feet away, the path she took was so confusing I felt unsure I&#x2019;d ever be able to find my way back.</p> <p>I hurried to keep up. It was incredibly hot&#x2014;Grifonian heat being different, somehow, from that of other places. Weightier. The sports park was filthy and smelled of sour milk, marijuana, and spilled wine. The yellow air shimmered around us, and sweat trickled down the sides of my face in persistent lines. Even the thin cotton dress I had on felt too heavy for the day. How did the Italians manage to look so fresh in weather like this? My bag sagged on my shoulder and I found myself thinking longingly of the deep, clean tub in my mother&#x2019;s bathroom, lined on the rim with glass jars of lavender salt.</p> <p>Gia led me through an alley, then down some stairs and across a busy street that was all curves and no stop signs. As I trailed after her, I was already preparing myself for another disappointment, horrified in particular by the way the Italians drove. Why on earth would I want to live on a traffic artery? Besides, there seemed to be nothing across the street but decrepit buildings.</p> <p>But then this potential landlady&#x2014;lithe, pierced, with her cropped white hair, ripped jeans, and loose red tank top&#x2014;opened a black gate, and all at once we were off the street and in a garden with a soaring view of Umbria. Vines climbed enchantingly up the side of the house; ripe lemons weighed heavily on a tree next to the door. Whether despite or because of the unpleasant walk, I was instantly, blindly smitten. It was sweet as a dollhouse, filled with miniature tables and chairs.</p> <p>I suppose there&#x2019;s a time in life when a garden of roses and lavender fails to blind a girl to the true shabbiness of a place. I myself had not reached that moment of clarity. The color of a stale biscuit with a red tile roof and peeling shutters, the building squatted at the end of the gravel yard, looking as if, at any moment, it might slide into the ravine below. The gate behind us stood open, I saw, inviting any passerby to come in and enjoy the view. Gia jiggled the door of the cottage for a moment and then, with an apologetic smile, pushed it open without a key. Even at twenty-five, I believe I would have said no. But I was twenty-one, and to my naive eyes the whitewashed hut was a paradise.</p> <p>Later, after everything, I wondered if it was the place itself that was cursed. It would make sense, after all. The cottage stood directly across from what had been a school for wayward girls. Gia later told us that in the seventies, when they tore the building down to erect a petrol station below our house, the builders found an old bureau filled with the tiny skeletons of discarded infants. Mightn&#x2019;t that have been enough in itself to render a spell into the ground?</p> <p>There was a large, wild garden below, perhaps as much as an acre. The cottage had once been a farmhouse, with terraced farmland that provided produce to the inhabitants within the city walls, Gia explained. The building was over three hundred years old. I could make out row upon row of fig and olive trees on the hill below us, then farther, a tangled, fragrant ravine. I&#x2019;ll plant vegetables and herbs, I thought. We&#x2019;ll have picnics. When I mentioned my idea of planting basil and rosemary, someone new behind me laughed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, the boys downstairs already have enough plants to make their own farm.&#x201d;</p> <p>I turned to see a woman with a warm face that was no less pleasant for the scars she&#x2019;d clearly incurred in a long-running war with acne. She was not as striking as Gia, but her countenance was kinder; she looked at you as if she were about to set you down in a large chair and feed you a plate of pastina, whether you were hungry or not.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Alessandra,&#x201d; she said, smiling.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Tabitha, but everyone calls me Taz.&#x201d; I put out my hand, but she brushed it off and kissed me on both cheeks instead. It was a custom I never grew used to, even at the end. Recovering, I smiled politely and stepped back.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t understand you, though. The neighbors are farmers?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I mean they grow plants, for <i>spinello.</i> Or they try.&#x201d;</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>&#x201c;They like drugs,&#x201d; Gia said, patting my arm. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not particularly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Smoke?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Now and then.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, <i>bella.</i>&#x201d; Alessandra gave me another squeeze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad. You are very sweet. Very cool. And you want to farm? You farm! Basil, pineapples. Anything you want.&#x201d;</p> <p>The house was tiny for four people, true. I was still comparing every space with my flat back in Nottingham, but I was heavily charmed. There was a small wood table with a bright ceramic bowl sitting on it, full of shiny apples. The walls were freshly painted white. The floor was cheap wood, but scattered with bright, clean rugs. Above the Lilliputian sitting area that consisted of a small sofa covered in a knitted blanket, van Gogh&#x2019;s <i>Starry Night</i> was tacked up, along with two posters of Johnny Depp. The kitchen was modest, but the countertops were scrubbed to a shine and the pots, pans, and knives hung in an orderly fashion. It was a poor house, but these were good Italian girls, clearly, and they had burrowed in and made themselves a home.</p> <p>There were two free rooms right next to each other, flanking the tiniest bathroom I&#x2019;d ever seen. The spaces were simple but clean, with one twin bed each, a dresser, and a desk. The two rooms were exactly the same in every respect, save that the one in the back had a window that opened up to a wide green-and-gold view of the Umbrian hills.</p> <p>Gia stood behind me, looking out. She stood closer than an English or Irish girl would. I tried not to visibly stiffen&#x2014;I had never been good with strangers.</p> <p>&#x201c;You have boyfriends?&#x201d; I tried.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure. You?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not right now.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Gia said. Alessandra looked me up and down in a way that was frank, but somehow not rude. These girls were older than I was. Twenty-five, twenty-six.</p> <p>&#x201c;It is very easy in Grifonia,&#x201d; Gia said.</p> <p>&#x201c;But don&#x2019;t pick the first one you see,&#x201d; Alessandra said. &#x201c;You are too nice for that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, for you it will be a barrel of fish shooting,&#x201d; Gia said, suddenly switching into English. I laughed, and they led me to the kitchen, where Gia poured us all a glass of wine, even though it wasn&#x2019;t even noon. It was terrible, worse than the cheap stuff we drank in Nottingham.</p> <p>&#x201c;From the <i>enoteca</i> around the corner. You take a water bottle, they fill it for you. Three euros.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mmmmmm.&#x201d; I took another sip for show. Alessandra took off her little cardigan now, revealing an emblazoned T-shirt straining against her motherly curves:</p> <p>YOUR NEVER FULLY DRESED WITH OUT A SMILE!!!</p> <p>&#x201c;We are gone a lot,&#x201d; Gia said, getting back to business.</p> <p>&#x201c;I understand. I&#x2019;ll be busy as well. My Enteria exchange&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ah, Enteria. Good,&#x201d; Alessandra said, pulling her long, dark hair up and fanning her neck. &#x201c;Not that we won&#x2019;t be around for you. You will be welcome to be with us at any time, <i>bella.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Any time,&#x201d; Gia repeated.</p> <p>&#x201c;Still, you will have many friends.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And there is an American girl, too, who just rented,&#x201d; Gia said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s away now, but you will be friends, I think. She is very sweet.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Lovely.&#x201d; I put down my wine. &#x201c;So, then, it&#x2019;s three hundred a month?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>S�.</i>&#x201d; They gave each other a look. Obviously, they themselves were paying significantly less. But it was their lease, and though three hundred was high, between the scholarship and the money my father had given me, I could afford it. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;</p> <p>I looked around at the terrace, the little table, the warm faces of my potential flatmates. I didn&#x2019;t want to look too excited, but this seemed exactly the place I&#x2019;d been dreaming of.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fantastic!&#x201d; Alessandra cried. And the girls embraced me again, showering me with more cheek kisses.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hate to ask,&#x201d; Gia said, stepping away first, &#x201c;but do you have&nbsp;&#x2026; a deposit?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Certainly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay to give it later,&#x201d; Alessandra said.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, no&#x2014;it&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I said. I reached in my purse, pulled out the envelope, and gave them two months&#x2019; worth of rent.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, <i>bella</i>, here is your kingdom,&#x201d; Alessandra said, kicking the bedroom door open lightly with her foot. &#x201c;You see? The bed, the closet, the desk. All yours. It is not big, but it has everything. Sheets and towels yo...</p></p><h2>Sleeping with Dogs: A Peripheral Autobiography</h2><p>Sleeping with Dogs is the record of one man&#39;s passionate affection for the dog, rooted in his early childhood and lasting undiminished into his dotage. These were for the most part dogs discarded and left to fate - tied to the railings of Kensington Gardens, found with a broken leg in the wilds of Turkey, adopted from an animal rescue home, passed on by the vet - but there was also a whippet of noble pedigree and three generations of a family of crossbreeds in which the whippet strain was strong. They were not pets, but indulged friends and companions, with all of whom he shared his bed, and who richly rewarded him with loyalty and affection. This is not a sentimental or determinedly anthropomorphic book - the dogs remain steadfastly dogs. It is observant and records the canine society of dog and dog as much as the relationship of man and dog. It is, at the same time, a deeply touching account of the lives and very different characters of seventeen dogs over eighty years or so, ranging from Jack Russell to Alsatian through half-boxer, half-pointer and half-Karabas, to purest indecipherable mongrel.</p><p>Addicted to art, Brian Sewell has been the art critic of the London Evening Standard since 1984 - the sad end of a once promising career, the Orwell, Hawthornden and other prizes scant consolation to a man who once enjoyed life as a scholar gypsy.</p><h2>The Thirty Years War</h2><p>Europe in 1618 was riven between Protestants and Catholics, Bourbon and Hapsburg--as well as empires, kingdoms, and countless principalities.

After success at Oxford, Wedgwood rejected an academic career and took up writing instead.

Charlotte Mendelson is perhaps unusually passionate about it. For despite her superficially normal existence, despite the fact that she has only six square metres of grotty urban soil and a few pots, she has a secret life. She is an extreme gardener, an obsessive, an addict. And like all addicts, she wants to spread the joy. Her garden may look like a nasty drunk old man&#39;s mini-allotment, chaotic, virtually flowerless, with weird recycling and nowhere to sit. When honoured friends are shown it, they tend to laugh. However, it is actually a tiny jungle, a minuscule farm, a wildly uneconomical experiment in intensive edible cultivation, on which she grows a taste of perhaps a hundred kinds of delicious fruits and odd vegetables. It is a source of infinite happiness and deep peace. It looks completely bonkers. Arguably, it&#39;s the most expensive, time-consuming, undecorative and self-indulgent way to grow a salad ever invented, but when tired or sad or cross it never fails to delight.</p><p>Charlotte Mendelson&#39;s first novel, Love in Idleness, was published in 2001.

Custer�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s expedition in the summer of 1874 found and advertised placer gold in the Black Hills valleys and a rush to the Hills began. Indian claimants to the area were placated, defeated or ignored and by 1875 a gold rush that continues to the present was under way. The Homestake Mining Company in the Black Hills is today one of the largest operating gold mines in the world. Thousands of unknown miners, merchants, gamblers and soiled doves have come and gone during the century past. And hundreds of towns have boomed and busted, most of them before the beginning of the twentieth century. This book takes a look at the remains of those ghosts: the camps, the stage stops, the communities, the people who made the Black Hills famous. In extensive gazetteer fashion, the authors detail 600 towns and enrich the text with a lavish layout of historical and contemporary photos. Also included are maps and tips on how to locate the ruins of those ghost towns.</p><p>Watson Parker by residence and research is a recognized authority on the Black Hills.

Spurning traditional roles for women of her era, she lived a bohemian life among other artists in New York&#x2019;s Greenwich Village and Paris, and embarked upon a career in what was then a male-dominated field. Decades later, her photographs are celebrated as some of the most authentic images of a city ever captured on film, and she is remembered not only as a master American photographer but also as a teacher, writer, inventor, and photographic archivist. <br><br>Veteran nonfiction writer George Sullivan draws on his vast knowledge of the photographic world to chronicle Berenice Abbott&#x2019;s life and career, and to present a fascinating social portrait of the artistic community of New York in the early half of the 20th century. Interviews with her contemporaries and high- quality reproductions of some of her most famous photographs provide an illuminating image of this determined, spirited woman who changed the face of American photography. Bibliography, index.</p><p>George Sullivan is a best-selling nonfiction author with more than 100 books to his credit, including highly accoladed <i>Berenice Abbott, Photographer.</i> He lives in New York City.*Starred Review* Gr. 6-9. Born in Ohio in 1898, Abbott made her way to Greenwich Village in 1918, and then to Paris, where she found her calling in photography, which she practiced with uncommon drive and an uncompromising sense of purpose for 60 years, primarily in New York City. In the 1930s she received financial support from the Federal Art Project for an ambitious project called Changing New York, traveling through Manhattan, photographing its streets, buildings, shops, and houses with the straightforward realism that characterized all her work. Later projects included science photography and teaching. Sullivan brings together an enormous amount of information about Abbott and presents it in a clear, thoughtful manner. Through discussions of Abbot's life and work, Sullivan reveals her personal strengths and shortcomings as well as establishing the scope and significance of her accomplishments. Large, clear reproductions of Abbott's photos appear throughout the book, and readers looking for more examples are referred to books as well as an online resource. Back matter includes source notes for the many quotes used and an extensive list of books and interviews.

The heartbreaking story of Kashmir has so far been told through the prism of the brutality of the Indian state, and the pro-independence demands of separatists. But there is another part of the story that has remained unrecorded and buried. Our Moon Has Blood Clots is the unspoken chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which it was purged of the Kashmiri Pandit community in a violent ethnic cleansing backed by Islamist militants. Hundreds of people were tortured and killed, and about 3,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave their homes and spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country. Rahul Pandita has written a deeply personal, powerful and unforgettable story of history, home and loss.</p><p>Rahul Pandita is a journalist and an author based in Delhi. He has also authored the bestselling Hello, Bastar: The Untold Story of India s Maoist Movement, and co-authored the critically acclaimed The Absent State. Pandita s last job was as editor (opinion and special stories) of The Hindu.&#34;This powerful and moving book throws a sharp new light onto one of the most tragic conflicts in the modern world. As a young boy, Rahul Pandita was exiled from his native Kashmir. Now, twenty years later, he returns to the prelude and aftermath of his exile, narrating his family&#39;s tortuous journeys with great sensitivity and skill. Every paragraph of this compelling memoir rings deeply true.&#34; --Ramachandra Guha</p><h2>The Fontana economic history of Europe</h2><p>For New condition books; You will be the first to open the book cover.

S. Gilbert, renowned author of the <i>Savoy Operas</i>, was also the creator of the <i>Bab Ballads</i>--"possibly the best comic verse--and surely the best illustrated--in the English language," according to James Ellis. Gilbert published these poems, together with his own, grotesque drawings signed "Bab," a childhood nickname, in <i>Fun</i> and other magazines in the late nineteenth century. </p><p> In 1898, the older and by then distinguished Gilbert substituted pallid and inoffensive drawings for the originals, which he had come to believe "erred gravely in the direction of unnecessary extravagance." Since then the ballads have been collected and published in various editions, most of which have featured the revised drawings and only a selection of the poems. </p><p> This is the only book to offer the complete collection of ballads with all original illustrations, a tribute to the comic genius of a writer known as "the most original dramatist of his generation."

But while Elizabeth remained a lifelong believer, her younger sisters chose vastly different lives. Seeking their fortunes in the North, Grace and Katharine reinvented themselves as radical thinkers whose literary works and organizing efforts brought the nation&#x2019;s attention to issues of region, race, and labor.</p><p>In <em>Sisters and Rebels</em>, National Humanities Award&#x2013;winning historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall follows the divergent paths of the Lumpkin sisters, who were &#x201c;estranged and yet forever entangled&#x201d; by their mutual obsession with the South. Tracing the wounds and unsung victories of the past through to the contemporary moment, Hall revives a buried tradition of Southern expatriation and progressivism; explores the lost, revolutionary zeal of the early twentieth century; and muses on the fraught ties of sisterhood.</p><p>Grounded in decades of research, the family&#x2019;s private papers, and interviews with Katharine and Grace, <em>Sisters and Rebels</em> unfolds an epic narrative of American history through the lives and works of three Southern women.</p> 35 black and white illustrations</p><p>Jacquelyn Dowd Hall grew up in a small town in Oklahoma,where the South meets the West. In college in Memphis and then graduate school in New York, she came of age with the civil rights and women's movements ofthe1960s and 1970s. She has been--at some level--thinking about the women or at least the kinds of women who populate <i>Sisters and Rebels</i> for most of her writing and teaching career.<br><br>She stumbled on Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin's autobiography while writing her first book. As founding director of the University of North Carolina's Southern Oral History Program, she learned that Katharine was only one of three fascinating sisters, each of whom grappled with a family legacy of slaveholding in which devotion to white supremacy and veneration of the Confederacy went hand in hand. The eldest, a true believer, had died ten years before. But Katharine and Grace, who, in her day, had been a celebrated radical novelist, were very much alive. Hall sought them out for interviews which,decades later, became the seeds of her new book.<br><br>Hall is currently Julia Cherry Spruill Professor Emerita at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Embedded within the extraordinary lives and works of the Lumpkin sisters, we find the "personal yet epic narrative" of their times--and of the South itself,especially its women.

Born in Dunbar in the east of Scotland in 1838, Muir is famed as the father of American conservation, and as the first person to promote the idea of National Parks. Combining acute observation with a sense of inner discovery, Muir&#39;s writings of his travels through some of the greatest landscapes on Earth, including the Carolinas, Florida, Alaska and those lands which were to become the great National Parks of Yosemite and the Sierra Valley, raise an awareness of nature to a spiritual dimension.These journals provide a unique marriage of scientific survey of natural history with lyrical and often amusing anecdotes, retaining a freshness, intensity and brutal honesty which will amaze the modern reader.

The protagonist is a 40-year-old New Yorker named Nona who thinks too much of and about herself. She ruins a perfectly decent marriage for a lousy affair and then wonders where she went wrong. She has other concerns, both past and present, that create pictures of one woman and--through her eyes--of those around her.The promise Nunez revealed in her acclaimed 1995 debut, A Feather on the Breath of God, is here fulfilled and magnified, as she follows the struggles of a woman to know her father and understand herself, labors that imperil her once secure marriage. Nona, little loved as a child and a pill-dependent insomniac as an adult, has found a measure of happiness hitherto unknown in her five-year marriage to Roy, with whom she shares a love of music and New York City life. Trouble erupts, however, during a monthlong visit to a friend's country estate, to which she retreats to work on a book about her father--an artist long dead, but out of her life even before that--when she meets brooding, handsome English prof Lyle and inexplicably finds herself opening up to him. He swamps her with love letters when they return to their respective homes, until she decides to visit him for a weekend in Tucson. His passion proves to have been written with disappearing ink, but back in New York, Nona finds that her marriage has slipped its moorings in her absence: She and Roy separate with rapidly dwindling hopes of reconciliation. In despair, she picks up the book project again, contacting her father's last lover, a man, who warms to her and reveals a side of daddy she never knew. She draws some comfort from her emerging knowledge of her father. Yoga and meditation, along with a dog, also provide comfort, enabling her to cope with a near- miss from breast cancer, and when Ray proposes a honeymoon they never had, she finds herself ready, tentatively, to begin again--a decision sorely tested when yet another unexpected disaster disrupts their lives. No dazzling, high-powered dynamics here, but, rather, a steady, superbly insightful study of a life as quietly complex as the reader's own: a tale that touches the heart of what it is to be human.

Generations of Louisiana historians have neglected this influx, involving more than 10,000 Saint-Domingue refugees between 1792 and 1810. These newcomers were subsequently joined by far smaller numbers of French citizens from Guadeloupe and Martinique. Not only were these immigrants largely responsible for the establishment and success of the state's sugar industry, but they also gave New Orleans many of its most notable early institutions--the French opera, newspapers, schools, and colleges--and ultimately its antebellum French flavor. The refugees also contributed Creole cuisine, Creole language, okra, and voodoo to their adopted homeland.</p> <p> Despite their significance, the refugees have attracted remarkably little scholarly attention. Louisiana's pioneer historians--Fran�ois Xavier Martin, Charles E. A. Gayarr�, and Alc�e Fortier--and their successors have generally accorded them only passing mention. The articles assembled in this anthology are the first to document the migrations and resettlement of these unfortunate people and to assess their impact upon New Orleans. Three of the four articles have appeared earlier in various scholarly journals, some of which are now defunct. Two of the articles have been translated from the original French by David Cheramie to make them accessible to English-speaking historians and genealogists, who had previously been unable to extract and utilize the wealth of information presented by the authors. </p> <p> The authors, widely recognized for their lasting contributions to the field of Saint-Domingue studies, trace the refugees' long, hard road to Louisiana. Thomas Fiehrer, an expert on the French Antilles, provides an overview of Louisiana's historical Caribbean connection. Gabriel Debien, dean of the French-Antillian historians, investigates the temporary relocation of the Saint-Domingue refugees in Cuba (1793-1815). Debien and the late New Orleans historian and genealogist Ren� LeGardeur recount the small-scale migration of refugees into southern Louisiana preceding the massive, early nineteenth-century influx, analyzed by noted Canadian historian Paul Lachance. Finally, the editors' introduction puts the foregoing essays into historical perspective and examines the impact of the refugees on Louisiana's rural parishes.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Artist&#39;s Guide to Composition</h2><p>Some marking to page edges.

Kaza (Environmental Studies/University of Vermont) tries to marry deep ecology with the ``Mountains and Rivers Sutra'' of the ninth-century Japanese Zen master Eihei Dogen. Like the sutra, the book progresses in five sections, beginning with the ``simple desire to meet trees and make contact'' to the desire to ``uncover more complete histories of individual trees,'' as well as to ``experience a certain vulnerability in raising difficult questions'' about life and death among trees and humans; then going, third, through an entering into the sufferings of trees and on, fourth, to a response in ways that ``are heartfelt and genuine'' and that ``aim for greater capacity in approaching the very demanding situation of trees today''; and, lastly, taking up a search for ways ``to restore spiritual as well as biological relationships with trees....'' Kaza is deeply serious as she strives for the heartfelt in trees growing up the Coast Ranges of central California, and in Washington, Oregon, and the Sierra Nevada. She fights TV and nature movies that offer ``delusional substitutes for rich, sensory contact with the actual rhythms and textures of the natural world'' (an argument very similar to Bill McKibben's in The Age of Missing Information, 1992). Hers are one- sided conversations: The redwoods, alders, maples, and oaks don't answer back. But we get many wonderful moments down in the drinking roots of sycamores; up in the spring ecstasy of pollinating maples; sitting in the still wisdom of caves; and watching a nervous Kaza, with a diamond mind and chain saw, cutting firewood that she praises. Too talky at times, but readers who stay will be rich winners. Could achieve a cult following.

The close buildings obscured her view of the renowned seawall and harbor some half-mile distant from the town. Yet even had the breakwater been within sight, her gaze coveted a still more remarkable spectacle: the sea itself. In all her three-and-twenty years, she had never before laid eyes upon the sea, and the narrow glimpses she managed to catch between buildings as her small party walked down to the shoreline only whetted her impatience to behold it unobstructed.<br>At last they reached the end of Broad Street, where a promontory opened up a commanding prospect, and she stopped to absorb the sight. She could see not only the harbor, but also miles beyond. The sun traced its descent toward the horizon, its rays diffused by clouds into muted green and yellow light that slid across the dark water rolling toward the beach.<br>&#x201c;Is it as you imagined?&#x201d;<br>Had her husband not stood directly beside her, his question might have gone unheard. The wind blowing across Lyme Bay tugged insistently at her bonnet, the ribbons beneath her chin straining to prevent its taking flight.<br>&#x201c;I could not possibly have imagined this.&#x201d; Though she had seen depictions of the sea, no canvas could capture its magnitude, nor the latent power she could feel even from their elevated vantage point. Tall-masted ships moored in the harbor, their mighty hulls dwarfing the smaller fishing boats bobbing round them with the incoming tide. Still more great vessels anchored beyond the seawall, majestic silhouettes against the horizon.<br>She turned to Darcy. &#x201c;Thank you for indulging my eagerness to walk down to the sea tonight. You and your sister have visited the coast on enough previous occasions that it cannot hold for you the novelty it does for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have never visited this part of the coast before. And I believe my appreciation of the sea is the greater for viewing it this time with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Despite my having drawn you and Georgiana out of our lodgings nearly the moment we arrived in Lyme?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The more so, because you did.&#x201d; Darcy smiled. &#x201c;I believe you are even more keen to experience the sea than is Lily-Anne.&#x201d;<br>Elizabeth had felt a touch of guilt upon leaving their young daughter with her nurse while the adults walked to the shore. Their family had been speaking with such anticipation about this holiday that although Lily-Anne&#x2019;s vocabulary was limited, &#x201c;sea&#x201d; had been among her most-used words for the past fortnight. The journey to Lyme, however, had tested the eighteen-month-old&#x2019;s temper beyond endurance. She would enjoy her first sight of the sea in the morning, after the proper night&#x2019;s rest for which her nurse was now settling her down.<br>Georgiana clamped a hand upon her hat. &#x201c;Lily-Anne would have been carried off by one of these gusts of wind. Do you think it will rain?&#x201d;<br>Darcy glanced at the sky. &#x201c;Not tonight. However, more clouds are forming, and sunset is not long off. We should continue to the beach so that we can see it and return to our lodgings before full dark.&#x201d;<br>As they descended steps down to the square, another gust swept the cliff, catching hold of Elizabeth&#x2019;s wide-brimmed straw bonnet. &#x201c;If I do not adjust my hat, the wind will carry&nbsp;<i>me</i>&nbsp;off,&#x201d; she said.<br>An inn, the Lion, stood not far up the street, with a narrow passage between it and its neighbor that would provide shelter from the wind. They walked to the building, and Elizabeth entered the alley while Darcy and Georgiana waited at its entrance.<br>She removed her gloves and tried to untie the bonnet. The wind, unfortunately, had strained the ribbons so taut against her jaw that now, though the ties had slackened in the sheltered space, they formed a knot so tight that she struggled to work it free. She glanced at Darcy and Georgiana, thinking to summon one of them for assistance. They, however, had become engaged in conversation with a couple she did not recognize. The lady appeared of an age similar to Georgiana&#x2019;s; the gentleman, about a decade older. The animated manner with which Darcy&#x2019;s sister spoke with the lady suggested the familiarity of previous acquaintance.<br>Electing not to interrupt, Elizabeth continued her solitary struggle. As she tried to coax the knot, she became aware that Darcy and Georgiana&#x2019;s conversation was not the only one taking place near her. Voices drifted through an open window of the inn.<br>&#x201c;Do not deny it&#x2014;I saw you leave the Sheet Anchor with one of them, and later walking on the Cobb with the other.&#x201d; The voice was a woman&#x2019;s: sharp, high-pitched. &#x201c;You told me you had done with them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have not seen either of them in I know not how long.&#x201d; This voice was male. Cultured. Condescending. &#x201c;I was not aware they were in Lyme until we happened to meet today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do not insult me with your lies; I know you better than anyone. And were that not enough, I have talked to each of them myself. You never stopped. All this time, I thought the business had ended. But you have been carrying on behind my back.&#x201d;<br>Elizabeth tugged harder at the ribbons. Uncomfortable with the accidental eavesdropping, she wanted to secure her hat and move along as quickly as possible.<br>&#x201c;My affairs are none of your concern.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Your</i>&nbsp;affairs? Those affairs never would have begun had I not been so foolish as to introduce you. We came here to meet them, did we not? You allowed me to believe we were on holiday, when all along you were planning these rendezvous.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of what have you to complain? You&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;on holiday,&#x201d; responded the man, who Elizabeth presumed was the woman&#x2019;s husband. &#x201c;You spend my money as if you were.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your money! And where is mine? Where is my share of what they have received all these years?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do I not provide for you? You are wearing your share. You dine on your share. You drive about town in your share, patronize half the shops in London with your share. So long as you live under my protection, whom I meet and why is&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;business.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your business&#x2014;and&nbsp;<i>you</i>&#x2014;can go to the devil.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Madam, at times I believe myself already in his company.&#x201d;<br>There followed an expletive which Elizabeth had never before heard uttered, let alone by a woman. She edged away from the window to distance herself from the scene of marital discord.<br>&#x201c;What of the promise you made me?&#x201d; the wife continued, her shrill voice rising to a volume Elizabeth could not escape despite the increased distance. &#x201c;Did you ever intend to keep it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have run out of time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not quite yet. I suggest you keep that fact in mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Depend upon it, I have.&#x201d;<br>A brief silence followed. Elizabeth hesitated to take another step, lest her retreat be heard and her presence realized.<br>&#x201c;I have friends in Lyme, you know.&#x201d; The wife&#x2019;s voice was calm, steadier.<br>The man issued a low, scornful chuckle. &#x201c;No doubt you do. Half the navy is ashore. Though in your current state, you hardly present an enticing object.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Certain individuals might be very interested in learning what I know. I am not the only person&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;affairs have betrayed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are hardly guiltless yourself. Unless you are an utter fool, you will keep your mouth shut.&#x201d;<br>The next sound was that of a door opening.<br>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d; the man said.<br>&#x201c;Out.&#x201d;<br>Though Elizabeth had failed to free her knotted ribbons, she hastened to rejoin her party. An accidental witness to the domestic drama, she had no desire to meet its actors.<br>Georgiana and Darcy were alone once more; the couple with whom they had been speaking were now a good twenty yards up the street, slowly negotiating the steep incline.<br>&#x201c;You just missed my friend Miss Ashford,&#x201d; Georgiana said. &#x201c;What a delightful surprise! I had no idea of her being in Lyme. She is here with her brother, who comes regularly. In fact, he likes it so well that he leases a house here throughout the year. They arrived a se&#x2019;nnight ago. They were just come from a promenade on the Cobb, which they highly recommend. Sir Laurence said the view from the top is very fine. They have gone every afternoon, and invited me to join them tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>Elizabeth took Georgiana&#x2019;s arm and continued walking, hoping to move their party along. &#x201c;I am glad you have found friends here. Are they Derbyshire acquaintances?&#x201d; She could not recall having heard the name before.<br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;their family home is in Somerset. I know Miss Ashford from London; she and I have studied with the same harp master since we were girls. I met her eldest brother once about three years ago, but this is the first time I have seen him since he inherited the baronetcy from his father. He is Sir Laurence now. That makes him sound older than merely &#x2018;Mr. Ashford,&#x2019; do you not think? Yet he is not too old&#x2014;&#x201d; She turned to her brother. &#x201c;I believe about the same age as you, Fitzwilliam. I did not realize until today that you know each other.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We have met occasionally at White&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Darcy said.<br>Georgiana, noting the unaltered state of Elizabeth&#x2019;s bonnet, offered her assistance, but Elizabeth declined.<br>&#x201c;It can wait. I am impatient to reach the waterfront.&#x201d; She glanced over her shoulder toward the inn&#x2019;s e...</p><h2>Numbers: Their Tales, Types, and Treasures</h2><p>Did you grow up thinking math is boring?

Set in a Florida retirement center called the Palms, the book follows a group of unforgettable residents over the course of a year as their humorous, triumphant narratives unfold.</p><p><b>James A. Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America. Among dozens of awards and honors, he received America&#x2019;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1977, and an award from the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities in 1983 for his commitment to art in America. Michener died in 1997 at the age of ninety.In his 41st book, Michener (Creatures of the Kingdom, 1993, etc.) offers a feel-good vision of life in a complex for the elderly, oddly skewed by its young protagonist. Obstetrician Andy Zorn has been chased out of the medical profession by unfair malpractice suits and eagerly accepts a job as director of the Palms, a Florida facility consisting of residential apartments, an infirmary, and a hospice (the center's owner cautions Zorn to avoid the word because ``it's ugly, frightening and reeks of death''). On the drive down to Florida from Chicago, Zorn plays good Samaritan and rescues a woman who loses her legs in a car accident, but after getting her to the hospital he scurries away for fear of being the subject of yet another malpractice suit. With his usual verbosity, Michener has Zorn handle with aplomb challenges that range from Alzheimer's to a constantly malfunctioning frozen yogurt machine in the Palms's dining room. Some of these episodes are entertaining (if in a very cozy way), but the focus is on Zorn's work in managing the facility rather than the lives of those who live there, and there is nothing surprising to win new Michener converts here. Although the Palms is described as possessing an idyllic, race-blind atmosphere, Michener occasionally exhibits racial insensitivity, as when he says of an African-American nurse, ``If one looked only at her ample face, one might have expected her to speak in a typical black dialect.'' Often it seems as though characters are being depicted as somewhat thickheaded just to give Michener the opportunity to expound on a subject he has researched heavily; Zorn's ignorance of AIDS is frankly unimaginable. As expected, there is a fair amount of death in this book, but never without an epiphany and a heavy dose of sentimentality. When the beautiful young woman Zorn rescued on the way to Florida tracks Zorn down and insists that she can only recover under his care and he allows her to move into the Palms, an inspirational, happy ending becomes inevitable.

This book considers various categories of jury, including trial jury, the coroner's jury, the grand jury, the special jury and the manor court jury. It also examines some lesser-known types of jury such as the market jury, the wide-streets jury, the lunacy jury, the jury of matrons and the valuation jury. Who were the men (or women) qualified to serve on these juries, and how could they be compelled to act? What were their experiences of the justice system, and how did they reach their decisions? The book also analyzes some of the controversies associated with the Irish jury system during the period, and examines problems facing the jury system, including the intimidation of jurors; bribery and corruption; jurors delivering verdicts against the weight of evidence and jurors refusing to carry out their duties. It evaluates public and legal perceptions of juries and contrasts the role of the 19th-century jury with that of the 21st century.

(Suspense).</p><p>C. J. Box is the author of five Joe Pickett novels, and has won the Anthony, Macavity, Gumshoe, and Barry awards. He has also been an Edgar Award and <b>Los Angeles Times</b> Book Prize finalist. A Wyoming native, Box serves on the board of directors for Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo.<i><b><p>Chapter 1<br>TUESDAY, AUGUST 25</p> </b> </i> <p>Three hours after he'd broken camp, repacked, and pushed his horses higher into the mountain range, Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett paused on the lip of a wide hollow basin and dug in his saddlebag for his notebook. The bow hunters had described where they'd tracked the wounded elk, and he matched the topography against their description.</p> <p>He glassed the basin with binoculars and noted the fingers of pine trees reaching down through the grassy swale and the craterlike depressions in the hollow they'd described. This, he determined, was the place.</p> <p>He'd settled into a familiar routine of riding until his muscles got stiff and his knees hurt. Then he'd climb down and lead his geldings Buddy and Blue Roanie&#x2014;a packhorse he'd named unimaginatively&#x2014;until he could loosen up and work the kinks out. He checked his gear and the panniers on Roanie often to make sure the load was well balanced, and he'd stop so he and his horses could rest and get a drink of water. The second day of riding brought back all the old aches, but they seemed closer to the surface now that he was in his mid-forties.</p> <p>Shifting his weight in the saddle toward the basin, he clicked his tongue and touched Buddy's sides with his spurs. The horse balked.</p> <p>"C'mon, Buddy," Joe said. "Let's go now, you knucklehead."</p> <p>Instead, Buddy turned his head back and seemed to implore Joe not to proceed.</p> <p>"Don't be ridiculous. <i>Go.</i>"</p> <p>Only when he dug his spurs in did Buddy shudder, sigh, and start the descent.</p> <p>"You act like I'm making you march to your death like a beef cow," Joe said. "Knock it off, now." He turned to check that his packhorse was coming along as well. "You doing okay, Blue Roanie? Don't pay any attention to Buddy. He's a knucklehead."</p> <p>But on the way down into the basin, Joe instinctively reached back and touched the butt of his shotgun in the saddle scabbard to assure himself it was there. Then he untied the leather thong that held it fast.</p> <br> <p>It was to have been a five-day horseback patrol before the summer gave way to fall and the hunting seasons began in earnest&#x2014;before a new game warden was assigned the district to take over from Joe, who, after a year in exile, was finally going home. He was more than ready.</p> <p>He'd spent the previous weekend packing up his house and shed and making plans to ride into the mountains on Monday, descend on Friday, and clean out his state-owned home in Baggs for the arrival of the new game warden the first of next week. Baggs ("Home of the Baggs Rattlers!") was a tough, beautiful, raggedy mountain town as old as the state itself. The community sprawled through the Little Snake River Valley on the same unpaved streets Butch Cassidy used to walk. Baggs was so isolated it was known within the department as the "warden's graveyard"&#x2014;the district where game wardens were sent to quit or die. Governor Spencer Rulon had hidden Joe there for his past transgressions, but after Rulon had won a second term in a landslide, he'd sent word through his people that Joe was no longer a liability. As luck had it, at the same time, Phil Kiner in Saddlestring took a new district in Cody and Joe quickly applied for&#x2014;and received&#x2014; his old district north in the Bighorns in Twelve Sleep County, where his family was.</p> <p>Despite his almost giddy excitement about moving back to his wife, Marybeth, and his daughters, he couldn't in good conscience vacate the area without investigating the complaint about the butchered elk. That wouldn't be fair to the new game warden, whoever he or she would be. He'd leave the other reported crimes to the sheriff.</p> <br> <p>Joe Pickett was lean, of medium height and medium build. His gray Stetson Rancher was stained with sweat and red dirt. A few silver hairs caught the sunlight on his temples and unshaved chin. He wore faded Wranglers, scuffed lace-up outfitter boots with stubby spurs, a red uniform shirt with the pronghorn antelope patch on his shoulder, and a badge over his breast pocket with the designation GF-54. A tooled leather belt that identified him as "Joe" held handcuffs, bear spray, and a service issue .40 Glock semiauto.</p> <p>With every mile of his last patrol of the Sierra Madre of southern Wyoming, Joe felt as if he were going back into time and to a place of immense and unnatural silence. With each muffled hoofbeat, the sense of foreboding got stronger until it enveloped him in a calm, dark dread that made the hair prick up on the back of his neck and on his forearms and that set his nerves on edge.</p> <p>The silence was disconcerting. It was late August but the normal alpine soundtrack was switched to mute. There were no insects humming in the grass, no squirrels chattering in the trees to signal his approach, no marmots standing up in the rocks on their hind legs and whistling, no deer or elk rustling in the shadows of the trees rimming the meadows where they fed, no grouse clucking or flushing. Yet he continued on, as if being pulled by a gravitational force. It was as if the front door of a dark and abandoned house slowly opened by itself before he could reach for the handle and the welcome was anything but warm. Despite the brilliant greens of the meadows or the subdued fireworks of alpine flowers, the sun-fused late summer morning seemed ten degrees cooler than it actually was.</p> <p>"Stop spooking yourself," he said aloud and with authority.</p> <p>But it wasn't just him. His horses were unusually twitchy and emotional. He could feel Buddy's tension through the saddle. Buddy's muscles were tight and balled, he breathed rapid shallow breaths, and his ears were up and alert. The old game trail he took was untracked and covered with a thin sheet of pine needles but it switchbacked up the mountain, and as they rose, the sky broke through the canopy and sent shafts of light like jail bars to the forest floor. Joe had to keep nudging and kissing at his mount to keep him going up the face of the mountain into the thick forest. Finally deep into the trees, he yearned for open places where he could see.</p> <br> <p>Joe was still unnerved by a brief conversation he'd had with a dubious local named Dave Farkus the day before at the trailhead.</p> <p>Joe was pulling the cinch tight on Buddy when Farkus emerged from the brush with a spinning rod in his hand. Short and wiry, with muttonchop sideburns and a slack expression on his face, Farkus had opened with, "So you're really goin' up there?"</p> <p>Joe said, "Yup."</p> <p>The fisherman said, "All I know for sure is I drink beer at the Dixon Club bar with about four old-timers who were here long before the energy workers got here and a hell of a lot longer than you. A couple of these guys are old enough they forgot more about these mountains than either of us will ever know. They ran cattle up there and they hunted up there for years. But you know what?"</p> <p>Joe felt a clench in his belly the way Farkus had asked. He said, "What?"</p> <p>"None of them old fellers will go up there anymore. Ever since that runner vanished, they say something just feels wrong."</p> <p>Joe said, "Feelings aren't a lot to go on."</p> <p>"That ain't all," said Farkus. "What about all the break-ins at cabins in the area and parked cars getting their windows smashed in at the trailheads? There's been a lot of that lately."</p> <p>"I heard," Joe said. "Sheriff Baird is looking into that, I believe."</p> <p>Farkus snorted.</p> <p>"Is there something you're not telling me?" Joe had asked.</p> <p>"No. But we all heard some of the rumors. You know, camps being looted. Tents getting slashed. I heard there were a couple of bow hunters who tried to poach an elk before the season opened. They hit one, followed the blood trail for miles to the top, but when they finally found the animal it had already been butchered and the meat all hauled away. Is that true?"</p> <p>Like most hunters who had broken the law, the bow hunters had come to Joe's office and turned themselves in. Joe had cited them for hunting elk out of season, but had been intrigued by their story. They seemed genuinely creeped out by what had happened. "That's what they said."</p> <p>Farkus widened his eyes. "So it's true after all. And that's what you're up to, isn't it? You're going up there to find whoever took their elk if you can. Well, I hope you do. Man, nobody likes the idea of somebody stealing another man's meat. That's beyond the pale. And this Wendigo crap&#x2014;where did that come from? Bunch of Indian mumbo-jumbo. Evil spirits, flesh eaters, I ask you. This ain't Canada, thank God. Wendigos are up there, not here, if they even exist. <i>Heh-heh.</i>"</p> <p>It was not much of a laugh, Joe thought. More like a nervous tic. A way of saying he didn't necessarily believe a word of what he'd just said&#x2014;unless Joe did.</p> <p>Joe said, <i>"Wendigos?"</i></p> <br> <p>They broke through the trees and emerged onto a treeless meadow walled by dark timber, and he stopped to look and listen. Joe squinted, looking for whatever was spooking his horses and him, hoping reluctantly to see a bear, a mountain lion, a wolverine, even a snake. But what he saw were mountains that tumbled like frozen ocean waves all the way south into Colorado, wispy puffball clouds that scudded over him immodestly showing their vulnerable white bellies, and his own mark left behind in the ankle-deep grass: parallel horse tracks, steaming piles of manure. There were no human structures of any kind in view and hadn't been for a full day. No power lines, microwave stations, or cell phone towers. The only proof that he was not riding across the same wilderness in the 1880s were the jet trails looking like snail tracks high in the sky.</p> <br> <p>The range ran south to north. He planned to summit the Sierra Madre by Wednesday, day three, and cross the 10,000-foot Continental Divide near Battle Pass. This was where the bow hunters said their elk had been cut up. Then he would head down toward No Name Creek on the west side of the divide and arrive at his pickup and horse trailer by midday Friday. If all went well.</p> <br> <p>The terrain got rougher the higher he rode, wild and unfamiliar. What he knew of it he'd seen from a helicopter and from aerial survey photos. The mountain range was severe and spectacular, with canyon after canyon, toothy rimrock ridges, and dense old-growth forests that had never been timbered because cutting logging roads into them would have been too technical and expensive to be worth it. The vistas from the summit were like scenery overkill: mountains to the horizon in every direction, veins of aspen in the folds already turning gold, high alpine lakes and cirques like blue poker chips tossed on green felt, hundreds of miles of lodgepole pine trees, many of which were in the throes of dying due to bark beetles and had turned the color of advanced rust.</p> <p>The cirques&#x2014;semicircular hollows with steep walls filled with snowmelt and big enough to boat across&#x2014;stair-stepped their way up the mountains. Those with outlets birthed tiny creeks and water sought water and melded into streams. Other cirques were self-contained: bathtubs that would fill, freeze during winter, and never drain out.</p> <br> <p>Prior to the five-day trek, Joe had been near the spine of the mountains only once, years before, when he was a participant in the massive search-and-rescue effort for the runner Farkus mentioned, Olympic hopeful Diane Shober, who'd parked her car at the trailhead and vanished on a long-distance run on the canyon trail. Her body had never been found. Her face was haunting and ubiquitous, though, because it peered out from hundreds of homemade handbills posted by her parents throughout Wyoming and Colorado. Joe kept her disappearance in mind as he rode, always alert for scraps of clothing, bones, or hair.</p> <p>Since he'd been assigned districts all over the State of Wyoming as both a game warden and Governor Rulon's point man, Joe ascribed certain personality traits to mountain ranges. He conceded his impressions were often unfair and partially based on his mood at the time or things he was going through. Rarely, though, had he changed his mind about a mountain range once he'd established its quirks and rhythms in his mind. The Tetons were flashy, cold, bloodless Eurotrash mountains&#x2014;too spectacular for their own good. They were the mountain equivalent of supermodels. The Gros Ventres were a rich graveyard of human history&#x2014;both American Indian and early white&#x2014;that held their secrets close and refused to accommodate the modern era. The Wind River Mountains were what the Tetons wanted to be: towering, incredibly wealthy with scenery and wildlife, vast, and spiritual. The Bighorns, Joe's mountains in northern Wyoming where his family still was waiting for him, were comfortable, rounded, and wry&#x2014;a retired All-Pro linebacker who still had it.</p> <p>But the Sierra Madre was still a mystery. He couldn't yet warm to the mountains, and he fought against being intimidated by their danger, isolation, and heartless beauty. The fruitless search for Diane Shober had planted the seed in his mind. These mountains were like a glimpse of a beautiful and exotic woman in a passing car, a gun on her lap, who refused to make eye contact.</p> <br> <p>He dismounted once he was on the floor of the basin to ease the pain in his knees and let his horses rest. As always, he wondered how horsemen and horsewomen of the past stayed mounted for hours on end and day after day. No wonder they drank so much whiskey, he thought.</p> <p>Joe led his horses through a stand of widely spaced lodgepole pines that gradually melded into a pocket of rare and twisted knotty pine. Trunks and branches were bizarre in shape and direction, with softball-sized joints like swollen knees. The knotty pine stand covered less than a quarter mile of the forest, just as the elk hunters had described. As he stood on the perimeter of the stand he slowly turned and noted the horizon of the basin that rose like the rim of a bowl in every direction. This was the first cirque. He was struck by how many locations in the mountains looked alike, how without man-made landmarks like power lines or radio towers, wilderness could turn into a maelstrom of green and rocky sameness. He wished the bow hunters had given him precise GPS coordinates so he could be sure this was the place, but the hunters were purists and had not carried Garmins. Still, though, they'd accurately described the basin and the cirque, as well as the knotty pine stand in the floor of it.</p> <p>In the back of his mind, Joe thought that if there really were men hiding out in these mountains stealing elk and vandalizing cabins and cars, they would likely be refugees of the man camps. Over the past few years, as natural-gas fields were drilled north of town, the energy companies had established man camps&#x2014;clumps of adjoining temporary mobile housing in the middle of sagebrush flats for their employees. The men&#x2014;and it was only men&#x2014;lived practically shoulder- to-shoulder. Obviously, it took a certain kind of person to stay there. Most of the temporary residents had traveled hundreds and thousands of miles to the most remote part of the least-populated state to work in the natural-gas fields and live in a man camp. The men were rough, independent, well armed, and flush with cash when they came to town. And when they did, it was the New Wild West. For months at a time, Joe had been called just about every Saturday night to assist the local police and sheriff 's deputies with breaking up fights.</p> <p>When the price of natural gas plummeted and drilling was no longer encouraged, the employees were let go. A half-dozen man camps sat deserted in the sagebrush desert. No one knew where the men went any more than they knew where they'd come from in the first place. That a fe...</p></p><h2>Hull Creek: A Novel of the Maine Coast</h2><p>After the death of his parents, Troy Hull left college to take on his family&#39;s traditional lobster-fishing life.

It's way beyond that; it's a great story..." --Nancy Griffin, The Free Press</p> <p>"Nichols ...writes plainly, powerfully and with firsthand knowledge...His midcoast is populated with characters that ring true - clammers, barkeepers, violent brutes, piratical schemers and Eddie Cranberry, a giant man reminiscent of Steinbeck's Lennie Small, only smellier. Hull Creek is a delightful read and, for those new to the coast, highly informative." --Colin Woodard, Working Waterfront</p> <p>"When (the swanks) get their comeuppance, you'll want to cheer - I had to suppress the yell that climbed up my throat as I was reading - but that's not the end of the story. There's still one more nail-biting drug escapade, and the swanks don't give up easily, especially since they've got the law on their side...Hull Creek is a good read and an important book that movingly dramatizes the plight of Maine's fishing families and the pressures that tourism and real estate speculation put on working waterfront communities." --Chris Busby, The Bollard</p> <p>"The strongest aspect of the novel is Nichols' ability to bring his fictional people to life through entertaining, candid dialogue... his layered story will appeal to a variety of people - especially those who know Maine well. The fictional fiddleheads, shags and small-town atmosphere and will lead any Mainer to believe that Troy Hull could be walking by outside their own windows." --Aislinn Sarnaki, Bangor Daily News</p> <p>"...Nichols manages to infuse Troy's tale with a healthy dose of humor. The story, the characters, and the conversations they have feel real. And if "Hull Creek" doesn't have a storybook ending, well, so much the better. It's a realistic ending, bittersweet perhaps, but Troy finds a way to keep his dignity, keep fishing, and build an even more fulfilling life for himself..." --Linc Bedrosian, National Fisherman</p> <p>"Maine's roots are here, and they are well worth our time and attention. 'Hull Creek' uses a suspenseful tale of change to show us that prosperity may be found in the paved driveways that lead to swanky summer homes, but nobility often lives in a trailer parked not far away on a dirt road with a sense of the past and a wide view of the water." -Nancy Grape, Portland Sunday Telegram Book Review</p></p><h2>Arts &amp; Crafts Home Plans: Showcasing 85 Home Plans in the Craftsman, Prairie and Bungalow Styles</h2><p>n Opening editorial chronicles the history and philosophy of the Arts &amp; Crafts school of design n Eye-catching exteriors and smooth, harmonius interiors celebrate the simplicity and honesty of these homes n A photographic study of several Craftsman homes and tips on creating an authentic Arts &amp; Crafts style interior are also included n Complete construction blueprints available for every home in this collection Let Arts &amp; Crafts Home Plans be your guide to this well known and beloved American home design.</p><p></p><h2>Corto Maltese: Ballad of the Salty Sea</h2><p><b>Celebrate this milestone in the history of graphic novels, winner of the world's first-ever "Best Graphic Novel" award, taking the prize in 1976 at the Angoul�me Fesitval.</b><br><br>Originally serialized beginning in 1967, this book is universally acknowledged as Hugo Pratt's masterpiece, in which he introduces Corto Maltese to the world. Corto is but one of a strong ensemble cast of characters whose lives permeate the entire 12-book series. It is here that we also meet the young and beautiful Pandora, her brother Cain, the mysterious criminal mastermind Monk, the grim and ferocious Rasputin, Lieutenant Slutter of the German Navy, and the natives Skull and Tarao. <i>The Ballad of the Salty Sea</i> is also hailed as the first example of the literary comic strip. Pratt was inspired by Conrad, Stevenson, and London, but even more directly by Henry de Vere Stacpool's <i>Blue Lagoon</i>, from which the author got the idea of a small island in the Pacific which he named "Escondida." <br><br>The action begins in November 1913 in the South Seas as feelings of the Great War were already looming but the romantic ideals of the nineteenth century were still alive. The pace of the narrative and the drawings are very modern and Pratt permeates the adventure with an extraordinary atmosphere of the great outdoors. The story captures the imagination of the reader from the opening pages with a tight, compelling storyline that can be interpreted on different levels. <br><br>This EuroComics edition features new translations from Pratt's original Italian scripts by Dean Mullaney, the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning editor of the Library of American Comics, and Simone Castaldi, Associate Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures at Hofstra, and the author of <i>Drawn and Dangerous: Italian Comics of the 1970s and 1980s</i> (University Press of Mississippi).</p><p>Hugo Pratt (1927-1995) is considered one of the great graphic novelists in the history of the medium. His strips, graphic works, and watercolors have been exhibited at the Grand Palais in Paris and the Vittoriano in Rome, and a landmark show in 2011 at the Pinacot�que in Paris drew 215,000 visitors, hailing Pratt as &#34;the inventor of the literary comic strip.&#34;</p><h2>Cookbook Book</h2><p><p><b>Over 100 of the most beautiful, influential and informative cookbooks of the past 300 years.</b></p><p>Compiled by a panel of experts in the fields of art, design, food and photography, <i>Cookbook Book</i> is an opus celebrating cookbooks of all shapes, sizes, languages and culinary traditions.

The cream coloured oxen stand with their heads down lazily whisking away with their tails the flies that torment them�</p><p>G. A. Henty's has here woven an exciting adventure tale that will keep the young reader on the edge of his seat while, without being aware of it, the reader will be learning detailed information about the Punic Wars and the political climate in which they took place. This is the perfect way to awaken interest in history in young people and encourage them to learn more. <p>This book has also been enhanced with additional illustrations and new maps to aid the reader in the understanding of the text. </p><p>Recommended for Ages 10 and up.</p>Lost Classics is proud to bring you another of G. A. Henty's adventure stories for boys. Henty wrote his first book for young people in 1868. Its popularity spawned some eighty more. This is the third Henty novel on the Lost Classics list. Writing in World magazine George Grant reminisced about reading Henty as a child: "Whenever I ran across (a Henty book) in our local library I quickly checked it out, rushed home, and read itusually without putting it down." <p>The Young Carthaginian is a departure from the first two Henty books on the Lost Classics list. Set in ancient times during the Punic wars between Carthage and Rome, it follows the adventures of young Malchus, an officer in Hannibal's army. Henty describes the army's incredible journey crossing the Alps in fascinating detail providing both a lesson in ancient history and a can't-put-it-down story. </p><p>An exciting excerpt from The Young Carthaginian: </p><p>"After lying for a couple of hours Malchus rose to his feet, and issuing from the bushes looked round. He had resumed his armor and sword. As he stepped out a sudden shout arose, and he saw within a hundred yards of him a body of natives, some hundred strong, approaching. They had already caught sight of him. </p><p>"'Nessus,' he exclaimed, without looking round, 'lie still! I am seen, and shall be taken in a minute. It is hopeless for me to try to escape. You will do me more good by remaining hid and trying to free me from their hands afterward.' </p><p>"So saying, and without drawing his sword, Malchus quietly advanced toward the natives, who were rushing down toward him with loud shouts. Flight or resistance would be, as he had at once seen, hopeless, and it was only by present submission he could hope to save his life." </p><p>Valuable Bonus for Homeschoolers--Includes a Build-Your-Vocabulary Glossary of some 501 words.

Around the country posters promise to &#39;crush all internal and external destructive elements as the common enemy&#39;, and a vast network of military intelligence ensures no one says or does anything to threaten the regime. In short, George Orwell&#39;s &#39;Big Brother&#39; is alive and well in Burma. Over the course of a year, Emma Larkin visited the places where Orwell lived, to meet the people who live there today. Starting in the former royal city of Mandalay, she travelled through the moody delta regions on the edge of the Bay of Bengal, to the mildewed splendour of the old port town Moulmein, and ending her journey in the mountains of the far north, in the forgotten town Orwell used as the setting for Burmese Days. The book journeys into the Orwellian land Burma&#39;s ruling generals have created, a place in which reality is distorted by censorship and truth is a dangerous commodity. Secret Histories uncovers the reality of life inside this secretive, totalitarian state. Emma Larkin presents a side to the country that the military government does not want revealed: a hidden world that can be found only in whispered conversations, covered books and the potent rumours wafting like vapours through the country&#39;s teashops.</p><p>Emma Larkin was born and brought up in Asia. She studied the Burmese language at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London while taking her masters in Asian History.

Larkin&#39;s reportage on modern Burma is every bit as fascinating as Orwell&#39;s Burmese essays of the 1930s.

In this way, she comes across not as an idealist but rather as an inquisitive and trustworthy guide to the underlying reality of a country whose leaders would rather have outsiders focus only on their carefully constructed veneer.

As the month of April began, only brief showers of gentle rain marred its brilliance. In the countryside, young lambs frolicked beside their mothers and villeins sent prayers of thanksgiving heavenward as the pliable earth turned easily beneath their ploughs. The townspeople, too, welcomed such a providential heralding of the summer to come. Goodwives threw out old rushes from the floors of their homes and replaced them with ones that were new and sweet smelling, linens soiled during the long months of winter were washed and hung out to dry and the walls of houses were given fresh coats of lime.</p><p>Only in the squalid suburb of Butwerk, which lay just outside the city walls, was there no sign of rejoicing, for the ditch called Werkdyke bordered the area and the accumulated rubbish in its depths had begun to steam as the temperature rose. It was a deep cavity, filled with detritus collected from streets within the town, and was comprised of offal, old bones, the contents of soil pots and glutinous blobs of decomposing vegetable matter. The stench of its noxious fumes drifted up and spread into Whore&#x2019;s Alley, where the prostitutes plied their trade, and floated above the gravestones in the cemetery of St. Bavon&#x2019;s, the dilapidated church that served the parish. Rats darted among the piles of refuse, vying with stray cats and dogs in their scavenging, while crows hopped and fluttered in their midst, cawing stridently.</p><p>The earliness of the hour and the miasmic atmosphere kept all who had the misfortune to live in Butwerk inside their dwellings, and so there was no one to remark the presence of the man that tramped beside the ditch. He walked with a purposeful stride, not heeding the loathsome odours that assailed his nostrils, and now that he was alone, he allowed the rage that he had kept hidden behind a pretence of genial civility to bubble up and come to the surface. After so many long months, it was almost time for him to carry out his plan for revenge. Only one final step remained, and that was to test the means by which he intended to extract it.</p><p>He searched among the carrion eaters for a suitable victim. Eventually, he spied a large dog with a matted black coat and ears that were mangled and torn. The animal was cowering near the edge of the ditch, trying to wriggle closer to a lump of maggot-infested meat that was being ferociously guarded by a feral tomcat.</p><p>Ignoring the feline, the man approached the dog. He spoke to it in soft tones, proffering a large chunk of salted pork. The cur was timorous at first but, unable to resist the food that was so tantalisingly near its nose, finally gave a tentative wag of its bedraggled tail and crept closer, its whole body quivering with expectation. When the animal came to a halt near the man&#x2019;s feet, its benefactor smeared the meat with a substance he took from the scrip at his belt and laid it on the ground. The dog quickly gulped the tidbit down and then raised its head hopefully, looking for more.</p><p>&#x201c;One portion is all that will be necessary to sate your hunger, my ugly friend,&#x201d; the man said gravely. &#x201c;You should have been less hasty and savoured the sweetness of its taste.&#x201d;</p><p>When it seemed that no further largesse would be forthcoming, the dog moved away from the man and resumed its envious contemplation of the tomcat. Within a few minutes the dog began to whine and hunkered down on its belly. Its distress became more evident as the animal&#x2019;s body began to tremble, and soon it was retching copiously and appeared to be in great pain. The man kept watch over the animal until, eventually, the exhausted dog fell onto its side and lay panting on the ground. It made one last feeble attempt to stand upright before a final shudder wracked its frame and it died.</p><p>The man felt no regret for the dog&#x2019;s death, only a sense of triumph. The poison was more effective than he had hoped. He raised his head and looked at the delicate white clouds scudding across the blueness of the April sky then dropped his gaze to the castle battlements and the spire of the Minster, their outlines standing stark on the horizon above the houses of the town spread out below. Soon all of those who had destroyed innocent lives would pay for the sins they had committed. With a mirthless smile of bitter anticipation, he raised his booted foot and pushed the dog&#x2019;s lifeless body over the edge of the ditch and into the foul depths of the Werkdyke.</p><p><b> One</b></p><p><i><b>Lincoln Spring 1201 A.D.</b></i></p><p><b>T</b>HE CASTLE AT LINCOLN SITS HIGH ATOP A HILL that overlooks the town, and it is built on the site of the old Roman fort called Lindum, hard by the broad highway of Ermine Street. Sharing the height with the castle is the Minster, and to the east, on the shoulder of the hill, is the Lincoln preceptory of the religious military order of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, commonly called the Knights Templar.</p><p>The enclave is moderate in size and encircled by a stout stone wall. Within its confines are a round chapel, refectory, dormitory, kitchen, storehouse, forge and stable, with a central open space used as a training ground. On the hillside below the compound is a stretch of grassland where the Order&#x2019;s horses are exercised.</p><p>On the morning of the day the poisoner claimed his first human victim, the preceptor of the commandery, Everard d&#x2019;Arderon, an older knight of some sixty years, was seated at a small table in the room that he used for his private quarters. Across from him, standing by the one window the room possessed, was Bascot de Marins, a Templar knight.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Bascot, you have made your decision, have you?&#x201d; d&#x2019;Arderon asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Preceptor. I have not much choice in the matter. The king&#x2019;s proposal is one that any man would find difficult to refuse. I must leave the Order.&#x201d;</p><p>D&#x2019;Arderon got up from his chair and paced to the far end of the room. He paused and turned to face Bascot. The younger knight looked tired, his attitude one of dejection. The preceptor remembered when de Marins had first come to Lincoln, some eighteen months before. The London master of the Templars, Thomas Berard, had sent him north, requesting the hereditary castellan of Lincoln castle, Nicolaa de la Haye, to give him a temporary place in her retinue so that he might have a space of time to heal from the rigors of eight long years spent as a captive of the infidels in the Holy Land. His bodily injuries&#x2014;an eye put out by the Saracens and an ankle badly damaged during his escape from a Muslim pirate ship&#x2014;were not all that afflicted him. The news, on his return to England, that his entire immediate family&#x2014;father, mother, brother and sister-by-marriage&#x2014;had perished in a pestilence during his absence had caused his faith to waver and he had announced his wish to resign from the Order. Berard, knowing that Bascot had conducted himself with valour prior to his capture, was loath to lose him and so had hoped that in the familiar routine of an English castle Bascot would recover his strength and his devotion to God. The master&#x2019;s remedy had worked, but not in the manner that he had hoped.</p><p>&#x201d;Tell me again of the king&#x2019;s promise,&#x201d; the preceptor said. He already knew well the terms of the pledge King John had made to the Templar knight, but he was trying to find time to think of some way to dissuade de Marins from his course.</p><p>&#x201c;He will restore to me my father&#x2019;s fief&#x2014;as you know it has been in the possession of the Crown since he and my older brother died&#x2014;on the condition that I resign from the Order and take up service in the Haye retinue.&#x201d; Bascot paused and then added, &#x201c;He has also said I will be allowed to select an heir of my own choosing if I do not marry and have sons of my own.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that last part is why you are doing this, is it not? For your waif?&#x201d;</p><p>Bascot&#x2019;s one remaining eye, the pale blue of a cold winter sky, grew hard and seemed to turn to ice. &#x201c;He is no longer a waif. He is my servant and I am responsible for his welfare. Without my protection he will return to what he once was, a homeless beggar.&#x201d;</p><p>D&#x2019;Arderon heaved a sigh and went back to his seat at the table. The boy they had been speaking of was Gianni, a mute urchin that Bascot had picked up two years before as he had journeyed back to England after his escape from the Saracens. Bascot had, over time, become as fond of the boy as if he had been his own true son, and he was now concerned that, if he rejoined the ranks of the Order, not only would the boy be rendered destitute but also that the affection between them would be lost forever.</p><p>&#x201c;Forgive me, Bascot, for my harsh words,&#x201d; d&#x2019;Arderon said in a placatory tone. &#x201c;I do not mean to denigrate the boy, but forswearing the vows you took when you joined the Order is no light matter. I do not wish you to embark on a course you will later regret.&#x201d;</p><p>Bascot&#x2019;s manner softened. He had a great liking for d&#x2019;Arderon and knew his sentiments were genuine. &#x201c;I know, Preceptor, and I appreciate your concern.&#x201d;</p><p>D&#x2019;Arderon reached out and took a small leather bag from a pile of similar pouches stacked in a corner of the room. They contained <i>al-Kandiq</i>, boiled sweets made from canes that grew in the Holy Land and were imported to England by the Templars. The anglicised version of their name was <i>candi</i>. The preceptor knew that Bascot was fond of them, as he was himself, and he opened the sack and tossed one to his companion.</p></p><h2>Style: An Anti-Textbook</h2><p>A professor of English critically views the quality and teaching of prose style in America and suggests immediate educational reforms</p><p>Richard A.

In this beautiful revised edition, Nerburn refines his advice and expands his thoughts.</p><p>A two-time winner of the Minnesota Book Award, <b>Kent Nerburn</b> is the author of thirteen books on spirituality and Native American themes, including <i>Simple Truths, Neither Wolf nor Dog,</i> and <i>Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce</i> (featured on the History Channel). He lives in northern Minnesota.Introduction<br><br>This is not a book I intended to write. The world is full enough of grand moralizing and private visions. The last thing I ever intended was to risk adding my name to the long list of those involved in such endeavors.<br><br>Then, in midlife, everything changed. I was surprised with the birth of a son.<br><br>Suddenly, issues that I had wrestled with in the course of my life and questions that I had long since put to rest rose up again in the eyes of my child. I saw before me a person who would have to make his way through the tangle of life by such lights as he could find. It was, and is, incumbent upon me to guide him.<br><br>For now this is easy. His life does not extend much beyond his reach. I can take him by the hand and lead him. But before long he will have to set out on his own. Where, then, will he find the hands to guide him?<br><br>I look around and I am concerned. The world is a cacophony of contrary visions, viewpoints, and recriminations. Yeats&#x2019;s ominous warning that the best lack all conviction while the worst are filled with passionate intensity seems to have come to pass. Good men everywhere realize that the world we have made is also the world we have failed, that our brightest dreams and our greatest fears lurk just over the horizon. Acutely aware of both, we stand mute, driven by our hopes, silenced by our doubts.<br><br>I can no longer afford this silence. I want my son to be a man of good heart who reaches out to the world around him with an open mind and a gentle touch. I want him to be a man of belief, but not a man of judgment. I want him to have explored his own moral landscape so that he will not unwittingly do harm to himself or others. To be such a man he needs to hear voices that speak with empathy, compassion, and realism about the issues of becoming a man.<br><br>And so I take my place among those attempting to pro- vide such a voice.<br><br>I bring to the task such skills as I have: a love of the lan- guage; a belief in the higher visions of the human species; a complex m�lange of anger, wonder, and despair at the world in which we live; years of learning, miles of travel, a love for the wisdom of all spiritual traditions, and a faith in the inex- haustible miracle of the experience of life all around us.<br><br>But above all, I bring this:<br><br>One day last week a former student of mine methodical- ly drove his car to the end of a street, pushed the accelerator to the floor, and catapulted himself off a cliff into a lake far below. On the same day I listened to a man speaking about his journey to India to study with a woman who could read his spirit by laying her hands on the sides of his head and staring into his eyes. That evening I found myself sitting with an old drunken man on a bench outside a store talking about the pleasures of catfish.<br><br>It is my gift to be able to embrace all these people and all their truths without placing one above the other. I can enter into their beliefs and give assent to each of them and learn from each of them. And I can pass their truths along.<br><br>This may not seem like much. But I value it above all else. The lonely old neighbor with her thirty-six cats, the shining young man at the door with his handful of religious literature, the good teacher, the honest preacher, the junkie, the mother, the bum in the park who told me never to take a job where I had to wear the top button of my collar buttoned and not to mess up my life like he did I can hear all their truths and I can celebrate them.<br><br>If I can take these simple truths and elevate them beyond the anecdotal, I can offer something of value to my son and to other fathers&#x2019; sons. I can offer a vision of manhood that is both aware of our human condition and alive to our human potential. I can offer the distilled insights of the dreamers and the doubters, the common and the rare. And in the process, perhaps I can reveal something about manhood to those readers, both male and female, who seek a compassion- ate place from which to survey the vast and confusing landscape before us.<br><br> Kent Nerburn<br>Bemidji, Minnesota 1999<br><br>Prologue<br><br>A Father&#x2019;s Wish<br><br>I write this book as a father not just as your father but as any father. Until you have a son of you own, you will never know what that means. You will never know the joy beyond joy, the love beyond feeling that resonates in the heart of a father as he looks upon his son. You will never know the sense of honor that makes a man want to be more than he is and to pass something good and hopeful into the hands of his son. And you will never know the heartbreak of the fathers who are haunted by the personal demons that keep them from being the men they want their sons to see.<br><br>You will see only the man that stands before you, or who has left your life, who exerts a power over you, for good or for ill, that will never let go.<br><br>It is a great privilege and a great burden to be that man. There is something that must be passed from father to son, or it is never passed as clearly. It is a sense of manhood, of self-worth, of responsibility to the world around us.<br><br>And yet, how to put it in words? We live in a time when it is hard to speak from the heart. Our lives are smothered by a thousand trivialities and the poetry of our spirits is silenced by the thoughts and cares of daily affairs. The song that lives in our hearts, the song that we have waited to share, the song of being a man, is silent. We find ourselves full of advice but devoid of belief.<br><br>And so, I want to speak to you honestly. I do not have answers. But I do understand the questions. I see you strug- gling and discovering and striving upward, and I see myself reflected in your eyes and in your days. In some deep and fundamental way, I have been there, and I want to share.<br><br>I, too, have learned to walk, to run, to fall. I have had a first love. I have known fear and anger and sadness. My heart has been broken and I have known moments when the hand of God seemed to be on my shoulder. I have wept tears of sorrow and tears of joy.<br><br>There have been times of darkness when I thought I would never again see light, and there have been times when I wanted to dance and sing and hug every person I met.<br><br>I have felt myself emptied into the mystery of the uni- verse, and I have had moments when the smallest slight threw me into a rage.<br><br>I have carried others when I barely had the strength to walk myself, and I have left others standing by the side of the road with their hands outstretched for help.<br><br>Sometimes I feel I have done more than anyone can ask; other times I feel I am a charlatan and a failure. I carry with- in me the spark of greatness and the darkness of heartless crimes.<br><br>In short, I am a man, as are you.<br><br>Although you will walk your own earth and move through your own time, the same sun will rise on you that rose on me, and the same seasons will course across your life as moved across mine. We will always be different, but we will always be the same.<br><br>And that is what this book is about. It is my attempt to give you the lessons of my life, so that you can use them in yours. They are not meant to make you into me. It is my greatest joy to watch you become yourself. But time reveals truths, and these truths are greater than either of us. If I can give them voice in a way that allows me to walk beside you during your days, then I will have done well.<br><br>To be your father is the greatest honor I have ever received. It allowed me to touch mystery for a moment, and to see my love made flesh. If I could have but one wish, it would be for you to pass that love along. After all, there is not much more to life than that.</p><h2>Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>Druids, Gods and Heroes from Celtic Mythology (World Mythologies)</h2><p>Numerous authentic Celtic myths and legends, from the most ancient Irish tales to the saga of King Arthur, are retold in this illustrated volume</p><p>Grade 6 Up The presentation of the material in this addition to the series is the same as in the other volumes: the book is oversized with two columns of print per page; full-color, full-page illustrations as well as small black-and-white illustrations, all of which are rather static; a very complete index, bibliography, explanation of symbols, pronunciation guide; and a text that is as static as the illustrations. The strength of the book is that it gives very complete coverage of the subject. Detailed background information is given, as well as brief, terse retellings of a number of the myths. But the writing is simply functional and gets the maximum amount of information across with the minimum amount of spark. There are chapters on the Celtic world in general, the gods of Celtic Ireland, the Welsh Mabinogion cycle, and the King Arthur cycle. Therefore, as a straight informational text, this is a good choice. Those looking for well-written coverage of some of the same information should turn to Alan Garner's The Lad of the Gad (Philomel, 1980; o.p.), Margaret Hodges' The Other World (Farrar, 1978; o.p.), and Howard Pyle's ``King Arthur'' books (Scribners).

Cast in the form of a burlesque walking tour through Europe, it showcases his unparalleled ability to integrate humorous sketches, autobiographical tidbits, and historical anecdotes in a consistently entertaining narrative.</p><p>Nearly nine decades after his death, Mark Twain remains an international icon. His white-maned, mustachioed image is instantly identifiable throughout the world, the very picture of probity and high spirits (which explains why he's become the poster boy for products as diverse as beer, billiard tables, sewing machines, pizza, and real estate). Perhaps more importantly, Twain's books have retained all their power to amuse and enrage. How is it possible for the creator of a 19th-century "boy's holiday book" (Twain's own description of <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>) to raise so many contemporary hackles? The answer is that Twain <i>is</i> a contemporary writer. Not, of course, from a chronological point of view--he was born in Missouri in 1835 and died in 1910 (having insisted that "annihilation has no terrors for me"). But Twain was the first writer to elevate the American vernacular to a high art. Sidestepping the starched-shirt diction of his peers, he created an idiom that resembled (but did not precisely duplicate) the wayward, slangy, ungrammatical music of American conversation. No serious reader of Twain will want to do without the <i>Oxford Mark Twain</i>. This 29-volume leviathan includes not only the major works but also a treasure trove of essays and short pieces, many of them unavailable for decades. Throw in the introductions to each volume (by such heavyweights as Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut, Cynthia Ozick, Gore Vidal, George Plimpton, Bobbie Ann Mason, and Walter Mosley), as well as the original illustrations, and you've got the book bargain of the millennium.In "A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain's unofficial sequel to "The Innocents Abroad, the author records his hilarious and diverse observations and insights while on a fifteen-month walking trip through Central Europe and the Alps. "Here you have Twain's inimitable mix," writes Dave Eggers in his Introduction, "of the folksy and the effortlessly erudite, his unshakable good sense and his legendary wit, his knack for the easy relation of a perfect anecdote, and some achingly beautiful nature writing." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic reproduces the text of the first American edition and features new explanatory notes and a critical Afterword by Kerry Driscoll, professor of English at Saint Joseph College in Connecticut.</p><h2>A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages, Vol. 1: 378-1278 AD</h2><p>Book by Oman, Charles William Chadwick, Sir</p><p></p><h2>It Gave Everybody Something to Do,</h2><p>Product used with some mild wear.

Not only was that dynasty rich in new and long-lasting techniques, such as carving, inlaying with mother-of-pearl, and infilling incised decoration with gold, but for the earlier periods the material surviving is much more scanty. However, fine pieces from the Han, Tang, and Sung dynasties are illustrated and discussed, and the first products from as far back as the Shang dynasties are identified.</p><p></p><h2>Durandal</h2><p>Durandal - one of the greatest epics of heroic fiction ever written - has been influence upon and model for a score or more tales of swordplay and adventure. Durandal, of course, is the fabled sword of history and legend which somehow found its way into Africa, and finally into the Near-East, after the death of the warrior-hero Roland, knight of Charlemagne. Durandal is the tale of two Crusaders, Sir Hugh of Taranto and the strange Celt, Donn Dera, whose band of 800 has been betrayed by the Christian Emperor Theodore and butchered by the Seljuk Turks of Kai Kosru. In company with Arab adventurers, Sir Hugh and Donn Dera capture the near-impregnable fortress of Kai Kosru from within, while the Emperor hammers at its outer defences. Here, the fabled sword finds its way to Sir Hugh&#39;s hand in the throne room of Kai Kosru, and the Crusader begins a quest for vengeance. This is the first of three related volumes which appeared in Adventure more than fifty years ago. They are somber and moody tales, full of incredible battles, betrayals, and treachery. The author is the same Harold Lamb whose marvelous historical biographies of Genghis Khan, Hannibal, and Tamerlane have been best sellers for decades. His fiction - masterful high adventure sometimes blended with modest elements of fantasy - is a delight for the reader, as it was in the day sof Robert E. Howard. Durandal contains 6 full-color illustrations by Alicia Austin and George Barr. Introduction by Glenn Lord.</p><p></p><h2>T4: A Novel</h2><p>It is 1939.

Not many will have the opportunity to explore in depth the great desert regions of the U.S.; here, Zwinger offers a compelling, vicarious experience. In the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas and New Mexico we find a "light-absorbing, heat-inhaling landscape that translates heat into wavering light and light into shimmering heat." Dominant plant in the Sonoran Desert (Arizona) is the saguaro cactus; Zwinger spent six days alone in a wildlife refuge here counting bighorn sheep in June temperatures of 110-112. She discusses the physiology of water loss and intake, the adaptations needed for survival in the desert. From a plane, notes Zwinger, the Mojave Desert shows exquisite but intimidating landforms. She points out changes in plant life and explains the different systems of photosynthesis that enable desert flora to survive. The Great Basin desert, stretching from Nevada to Oregon, is mostly above 4000 ft.; it is a cold steppe desert with jackrabbits and horned larks, sagebrush and greasewood. Zwinger gives us a masterly interpretation of these mysterious lands. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this book, the author, an award-winning naturalist, describes the flora and fauna of the Chihauhuan, Sonoran, Mohave, and Great Basin deserts of the American Southwest.

That it also affords entry to a world of fascinating design and superb craftsmanship goes without saying. In addition to illustrating in color and discussing in detail 108 distinguished inro and their accompanying <i>netsuke</i>, as well as 18 related miniature objects, it presents highly informative essays on the making of <i>inro</i>, on pearl shell inlays, and, in particular on the materials and techniques of lacquer art, the last of these with 62 color photos. It also furnishes an extensive list of lacquer artists' signatures with 386 photos. It is refreshing to have an author tell his readers not only what his book is but also what it is not. In his introduction Bushell says: "This book is addressed to the collector of <i>inro, netsuke, </i> and other forms of miniature Japanese art, with emphasis on works in lacquer. Its purpose is specific and limited. It is not a comprehensive study of lacquer. It is not a historical survey, a technical analysis, a comparative examination, or a compendium of terms and definitions. In point of time it is limited to the Tokugawa, Meiji, Taisho, and early Showa periods. In point of craft it is limited to the later development of precise and sophisticated techniques, with their brilliant decorative effects." Bushell points out that he is not making an unnecessary emotional appeal in praise of lacquer. His objective is far more practical. This book is the product of his efforts to understand the structure underlying the beauty of lacquer art and to provide clear and simple explanations. Because other books on the subject had not satisfied him, he undertook his own basic research, and here he presents the information he acquired through painstaking study with master lacquer craftsmen and other authorities.</p><p>Raymond Bushell, attorney, collector, and netsuke authority, is known to netsuke collectors for his adaptation into English of <i>The Netsuke Handbook of Ueda Reikichi, </i>an important work on the subject. He is the author of <i>The Wonderful World of Netsuke, An Introduction to Netsuke, Netsuke Familiar and Unfamiliar, The Inro Handbook, The Art of Netsuke Carving, </i>and<i> Collectors' Netsuke. </i>He is also a frequent contributor of articles to <i> Arts of Asia, The Journal of International Netsuke Collectors, </i> and <i>The Netsuke Kenkyukai Study Journal. </i> He arrived in Japan with the American occupation forces in 1945 and lived there until 1990 practicing law, collecting, and studying netsuke, inro, and sword furnishings.</p><h2>The Crossley ID Guide: Waterfowl</h2><p><i><b>"This spectacular and meticulously assembled guide provides a unique way to master identification of North America's diverse waterfowl, both on the water and in the air." - </b></i><b>John Fitzpatrick, director, Cornell Lab of Ornithology</b><br><br> <i><b>"Waterfowl have long captured the attention of birders, sportsmen, photographers, artists, and practically anyone with an eye for beautiful creatures set in beautiful places.

Philip Van Rensselaer was her companion and confidant. Here he dramatically re-creates the events of her life as she related the stories to him, in a book that captures the extravagance and glamour of the International Set. Called by Truman Capote the &#39;most incredible phenomenon of the century,&#39; Barbara Hutton lived a gold-plated life. Her extravagance was fabled. She spent $25,000,000 in a decade - which would be $250,000,000 today. Her parties, clothes, jewelry and furs - all flaunted during the Depression years - made her the envy of women around the world. Her romances with royalty and celebrities were frequent, headline-making, and more often than not, disastrous. She was as famous in the &#39;30s and &#39;40s as Hemingway and Hitler. Though she was married to a handsome Russian prince, a dazzling Danish count, and to the most sought-after actor in the world - Cary Grant - Barbara Hutton was a vulnerable woman, haunted by loneliness. Descended from robber barons, Barbara Hutton&#39;s grandfather Frank Woolworth left her an astonishing legacy of $25 million and a Fifth Avenue palace. She casually acquired a stately English mansion, into which she poured $5 million for renovations, a palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, a castle in Tangier, and a Japanese-style home in Cuernavaca. She surrounded herself with liveried servants and a host of hangers-on, who benefited from her great generosity. Despite her opulent surroundings, Barbara&#39;s life was not the stuff of fairy tales. Her mother committed suicide and her businessman father was cold and indifferent. At the age of sixteen, she got her first glimpse of European high life in Biarritz, where she met Elsa Maxwell (who played an important part in Barbara&#39;s life)...&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Erotic Manga: Draw Like the Experts</h2><p><p>With its adult-oriented themes, <em>Erotic Manga</em> is perfect for grown-up fans of Japanese comics, as well as aficionados of adult art.</p><p>This book is a comprehensive guide that will teach artists of all levels, from beginner to advanced, the basics of creating characters from <em>shonen</em> and soft-core, <em>hentai</em> comics.

Villains of all Nations rediscovers their radical democratic challenge to the established powers of the day.</p><p>MARCUS REDIKER is Distinguished Professor of Atlantic History at the University of Pittsburgh. His other books include The Many-Headed Hydra, written with Peter Linebaugh, and The Slave Ship: A Human History. He lives in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia.Rediker (<i>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</i>), a historian of maritime labor, opens his immensely readable study of the "golden age" of piracy (1716-1726) with the spectacle of an execution in which a notorious pirate, unrepentant and seemingly unconcerned to be facing death, reties the knot of his gallows noose with defiant ironic humor. For Rediker, pirates were bold subversives who challenged the prevailing social order and empire building of the five main trading nations. Emphasizing the hardship, injustice and brutality the average sailor faced in his career, Rediker suggests that piracy offered a more egalitarian seafaring life, as well as opportunities for revenge on the ruling class. Rediker uses captives' accounts, among other sources, to show how pirates meted out their own system of justice, torturing captains reputed for their harsh treatment of sailors, yet sparing others known for fairness. He explores pirate dialects, rituals and symbols, and shows how pirates inverted social norms, creating a carnivalesque way of life that featured fraternal solidarity, a precapitalist share system and the wanton destruction of property. A chapter on picaresque women pirates reveals links between their iconic image and Delacroix's painting <i>Liberty.</i> Using statistics to show convincingly that by the 1720s piracy posed a real threat to global trade, Rediker describes how nations launched a military-legal campaign against piracy, with cannon battles and gruesome public executions. Rediker uses this apocalyptic close of piracy's golden age to explore its suicidal side. Although Rediker's short study does not tackle later myths of piracy, it provides penetrating background to our enduring cultural fascination with the seafaring outlaws.

Largely overshadowed by the Battle of the Bulge further north, Nordwind was the last great operation by the Waffen-SS Panzer divisions in the west, and the last time the Wehrmacht was on the offensive in the West. The campaign also highlights the difficulties of inter-Allied cooperation between the Americans and the French.

America has changed dramatically since then, and so has its conceptions of what parkland ought to be. <br><br>In this book, one of our premier environmental historians looks at the new phenomenon of urban parks, focusing on San Francisco's Golden Gate National Recreation Area as a prototype for the twenty-first century. Cobbled together from public and private lands in a politically charged arena, the GGNRA represents a new direction for parks as it highlights the long-standing tension within the National Park Service between preservation and recreation.<br><br>Long a center of conservation, the Bay Area was well positioned for such an innovative concept. Writing with insight and wit, Rothman reveals the many complex challenges that local leaders, politicians, and the NPS faced as they attempted to administer sites in this area. He tells how Representative Phillip Burton guided a comprehensive bill through Congress to establish the park and how he and others expanded the acreage of the GGNRA, redefined its mission to the public, forged an identity for interconnected parks, and struggled against formidable odds to obtain the San Francisco Presidio and convert it into a national park.<br><br>Engagingly written, <i>The New Urban Park</i> offers a balanced examination of grassroots politics and its effect on municipal, state, and federal policy. While most national parks dominate the economies of their regions, GGNRA was from the start tied to the multifaceted needs of its public and political constituents-including neighborhood, ethnic, and labor interests as well as the usual supporters from the conservation movement. <br><br>As a national recreation area, GGNRA helped redefine that category in the public mind. By the dawn of the new century, it had already become one of the premier national park areas in terms of visitation. Now as public lands become increasingly scarce, GGNRA may well represent the future of national parks in America. Rothman shows that this model works, and his book will be an invaluable resource for planning tomorrow's parks.</p><p>"A significant contribution to the field and a model for all future studies of the so-called urban park phenomenon. Rothman's ability to place local park developments into a broader regional and national perspective gives the book exceptional strength."--Arthur R. G�mez, National Park Service historian and author of <i>Quest for the Golden Circle: The Four Corners and the Metropolitan West, 1945-1970</i> <p>"With wit, intelligence, and a lively writing style, Rothman provides an impressive, well researched, and important contribution to environmental and western history."--Albert S.

Originally published in 1970, this book examines the circumstances of the murder, accused assassin James Earl Ray&#x2019;s flight and capture, and the failures of the justice system in this case.<br><br>While many books about the King assassination have followed <i>Frame-Up</i>, this work remains unrivaled in its retelling of the circumstances which led Ray to plead guilty in a grossly inadequate &#x201c;mini trial,&#x201d; and Ray&#x2019;s almost immediate failed attempt to retract this confession.<br><br>Weisberg also dissects the evidence in the case, and concludes that while Ray was a part of the conspiracy, he did not shoot Dr. King, serving as another &#x201c;patsy&#x201d; in the troubling assassinations of the 1960s.</p><p><strong>Harold Weisberg</strong> is the author of a number of books on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, including the <em>Whitewash </em>series, <em>Oswald in New Orleans</em>,<em> Post Mortem</em>, <em>Never Again!</em>, and <em>Case Open</em>.

And yet, his actual economic writing has remained something of an enigma. Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, his best-known work, was also an unscientific throw-off in his view. His major economic works - The Theory of Economic Development and Business Cycles - have been misunderstood and underappreciated. What has not been realized is that key elements of the Schumpeterian system have hitherto gone missing. Clues to that system were contained in his magisterial History of Economic Analysis, but the full-orbed outworking was contained in his unpublished German manuscript on money and banking. Now published in English translation, the Treatise on Money provides the key to understanding Schumpeter&#39;s system. It shows that Schumpeter&#39;s famous emphasis on &#39;creative destruction&#39; is a more complex phenomenon than is popularly understood. In particular, it provides an understanding of the workings of money, banking, and the money and capital markets, that are supremely relevant in the light of current monetary and fiscal policy crises. This present volume is therefore an indispensable contribution to revealing the true Schumpeter to the English-speaking world.</p><p></p><h2>Expositor&#39;s Study Bible KJV Crossfire Deluxe</h2><p>Limited Edition Signed Expositor's Study Bible KJV Crossfire Deluxe Brown Embossed Cover You are buying 1 new signed bible - This is a brand new signed bible - as shown Limited Edition Signed Expositor's Study Bible KJV Crossfire Deluxe Brown Embossed Cover YOU ARE BUYING 1 OF THE BEST STUDY BIBLES EVER CREATED &amp; SOLD NEW IN THE BOX AS SHOWN CROSSFIRE THE EXPOSITORS STUDY BIBLE DELUXE RED LETTER EDITION SOFT BROWN LEATHER TYPE EMBOSSED DESIGNER COVER LATEST CURRENT STUDY EDITION COPYRIGHT 2013 GOLD EDGED PAGES DUAL PAGE MARKERS 2440 PAGES SIGNED BY PASTOR SWAGGART The Bereans "received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so" (Acts 17:10-11) Solomon instructs us in Proverbs 2:1 "My son, if you receive my words, and treasure my commands within you. . . ."

Or why an emotion, thought or feeling occurs within you, out of proportion to the circumstance that triggered it? Ever felt beside yourself or not yourself during stressful situations, when it seems almost as if another you emerges? What is it? If you are searching for an answer, this book is the one to read. Dr. Rajan Sankaran, an internationally renowned homoeopath, author, teacher, and innovator has delivered profound insights on the inner human experience. These insights have revolutionized homeopathic practice all over the world and are also universally applicable and highly valuable to any one who is seeking answers to these questions. Stress does not come from external reality but how each one of us experiences it. And we each experience it in a different, completely unique way. When we probe deeper and deeper into our own experience of stress, we traverse different levels of experience of the world, and all that is temporary fades as a level is reached of a constant inner pattern in our lives which underlies all of our experience. This pattern reveals itself as a pure sensation of the being, which is felt in both the mind as well as the body at the same time and eventually expressing in clinically recognisable disease. This pattern or sensation reveals itself as a pattern or energy of something in nature a plant, an animal or a mineral. Along with our natural human song, another song plays within each of us. This other song drives our emotions, dreams, ambitions, work, relationships, illnesses and even our circumstances. In this book Dr. Sankaran guides us into a world of discovery of the inner world of our experience, where we can go beyond the story, the emotions, the situation, and discern the essence of something in nature, which is often concealed within the human expressions. By paying attention to hand gestures or doodles, unconscious paths of expression of the energy, you can perceive more and more the other song, the song that is causing stress or dis-ease. Awareness of this song s theme is the beginning of healing.</p><p>Dr. Rajan Sankaran is internationally renowned as a clear thinker and is best known for his path breaking concepts, especially his understanding of disease as a delusion, his use of mind symptoms and dreams, his classification of remedy states into kingdoms and his additions to the existing miasms.

Many of the books are considered modern texts in Homeopathy and have been translated in several languagesDear Doctor, After meeting you on 25th night, I was chatting with Uma and that is when I saw your notice about your book, 'The Other Song' and when I asked for a copy from Uma, luckily a copy was available and I could get hold of it. I was perhaps not entirely prepared for what I read. I have been to your web site and I have read few excerpts from your articles and books, but I had not understood the concept of sensation very well from these. As I started reading the book , I started understanding what you meant by sensation and the entire spectrum of experience from the level of Name - fact - feeling - delusion - sensation - energy became much more clearer. As I read the case studies at the end, it all became very vivid and clear. Similarly the concepts of Plant - Animal and Mineral families and the song belonging to that, also became far more clearer. Dr, I work in the area of HR, and hence I have some familiarity with Freud, and these categories reminded me of the categories that he was talking about - Narcissistic, Erotic and Obsessive respectively. However, reading your explanation brought a very different level of appreciation for these concepts. I have finished the book only today, and I must say that I am tremendously moved and impacted by the entire theory. It feels precious to know that I have the opportunity to interact with you. Your entire theory of 'the other song' resonates very deeply with me. I am not at all familiar with Homeopathy or any similar branch, but instinctively, the entire exposition feels very right and very apt. I read and re-read about your method of going deeper into sensation from delusions and feelings. The fact that non judgmental awareness is required to be able to do that. It touched me deeply ... I have a very analytical habit of mind ... hence it is very difficult for me to just observe and let the picture complete itself ... but the different case studies prove beyond doubt that this is the only way one can go deeper into the understanding of an individual, otherwise, one is just caught up in ones own frameworks and thought processes. Thank you for this learning. Finally, the three laws / postulates, 1. Sensation and action are equal and opposite. 2. The opposite for whatever is said is also true. 3. There is no one or nothing out there other than yourself. These are so apt!! Perfect! In our office we used to say, 'Whatever any one says, it is basically autobiographical', but I have understood this phenomenon at a much deeper level, thanks to you. Dr, I feel priveleged to know you and to know your view point about individuals and life. Thank you very much for sharing your wisdom with us through this book. In case you were to take up teaching this personally, I would like to have the honor of learning it directly from you. Thank you once more, With deep gratitude. --Anirudha Deshmukh HR Consultant<br><br>The Other Song is a triumph: the healing art is revealed! Rajan Sankaran s experiences and insights to date are united within an overarching philosophy and are made explicit and intelligible. His quest for the most reliable form of homeopathy has been unremitting. Furthermore, it is uncommon for an author in the field of homeopathic practice, to have been successful at penetrating so far into the core of the human condition, or to extend inquiry to include the spiritual domain. Please do not be put off by the introductory chapters, by the attempt to popularize, or by recasting homeopathic terms such as miasms into generic categories these are attempts by the author to reach a wider readership and they do not detract from the overall vision. I will be recommending this book to my students from year two onwards, as a perfect sequel to The Spirit of Homeopathy . --Misha Norland<br><br>The Other Song is about a new approach to the practice of homeopathic medicine. (Louise Valentine/The Epoch Times) The Other Song by Dr. Rajan Sankaran is a book for the public regarding his system of homeopathic medical practice. With a solid foundation in homeopathy as originally described by Samuel Hahnemann, M.D. (1755-1843), Dr. Sankaran and his team of homeopathic physicians in Mumbai, India, have spent many years refining this approach to homeopathic prescribing. They been teaching his method worldwide, and more homeopathic physicians are following this approach. The Other Song refers to the fact that within each of us there exists a human and a non-human song. The human song refers to ourselves when we are in a normal state. The non-human song, which is always with us, can be that of a plant, mineral, or an animal. The other song is frequently more evident during periods of stress. A human song is harmonious. So are the plant, mineral, and animal songs. However, when the human song and the non-human song are playing together, the result is discord. That discord leads to illness. The aim of treating a patient homeopathically with Dr. Sankaran's method is to turn down the volume of that plant, mineral, or animal that is playing within us. When that is done, health returns. Through careful questioning, the homeopath can discern from which kingdom the other song is playing. Then, through further questioning, the specific plant, mineral, or animal can be discovered. This method of inquiry takes the patient to a very deep state, beyond the intellect, to the core of their being, where frequently the patient expresses his or her state with hand gestures rather than words. In this semi-hypnotic state, the patient often can express and describe the other song quite clearly. Also, the reaction pattern of the patient can be determined, indicating his perceived nature of the illness, in ten categories ranging from panic to optimism to hopelessness. These reaction patterns help to find remedies after the kingdom is discovered. The issue with plants is their hypersensitivity and reactivity. The issue with minerals is their structure and the formation and challenges to the integrity of that structure. The issue with remedies in the animal kingdom is that of competition, comparison, and survival, which is brought out by a patient's speech, including his talk of being a victim or an aggressor. After determining that a patient needs a plant remedy, the family of plant is determined, and then the specific plant is found. If the patient needs a mineral remedy, it is determined which row and column of the periodic table the mineral is found. If a patient needs an animal kingdom remedy, the sub-kingdom is determined, and then the precise animal if found. For example, a patient came to Dr. Sankaran with urticaria [hives]. She personified the illness that she felt was persecuting her, and said that it hit her like a "punch." She felt victimized by the illness and her life situation. She was also verbally abusive to her husband and in-laws. From her expressions of being a victim, her competition with and jealousy of other family members, and other facets of her case, it was determined that she needed an animal kingdom remedy. As the interview proceeded, she expressed that she really didn't like insects, especially bees. She received a homeopathic dose of bee, following which her skin ailment went away, her perception of her life situation changed, and she became a more considerate and caring person to her spouse and in-laws. Dr. Sankaran's approach is the greatest single advance in homeopathic medicinal practice in the last century. The Other Song is an introduction to this new approach. --William Franklin McCoy,Epoch Times Staff</p><h2>On Shadow Beach</h2><p><b><i><br>The California town of Angel&#x2019;s Bay has had its share of troubles: from the long-unsolved murder of a teenage girl to the young police officer recently left in a coma after being shot.

Lauren Jamison put down her suitcase, feeling uneasy.<br> <br>Thirteen years had passed since she&#x2019;d been home, but the living room looked the same: the brown leather recliner by the fireplace where her dad read the paper every evening, the couch her sister, Abby, used to curl up on and write in her journal, the table by the window where her mother and little brother, David, played board games. The furniture remained, but all of the people were gone. All except one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; she called.<br> <br>The answering silence tightened her nerves. She needed her father to appear, to remind her that this <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> like before. Because thirteen years ago she&#x2019;d returned home late one night, an innocent seventeen-year-old, and found the front door open, lights blazing, and her mother sobbing hysterically. Nothing had been the same after that.<br> <br>The whistle of a teakettle drew her toward the kitchen, but the room was empty. She turned off the stove and moved into the hall, checking each bedroom. Her father&#x2019;s room was cluttered with clothes. Only the faded floral curtains betrayed her mother&#x2019;s once important influence on the d�cor. David&#x2019;s bedroom had been turned into an office that was covered in dust and papers. The room at the end of the hall had belonged to her and to Abby.<br> <br>The door was closed, and Lauren&#x2019;s steps slowed. Her father might have redone the room, boxed up Abby&#x2019;s things and given them to charity&#x2014;or the room might look exactly the same as it had the night Abby died. Her heart skipped a beat.<br> <br>She tapped on the door. &#x201c;Dad? Are you in there?&#x201d;<br> <br>When he didn&#x2019;t reply, she opened the door, scanned the room quickly, and then pulled the door shut, her breath coming hard and fast. Abby&#x2019;s side of the room was frozen in time, as if it were still waiting for her to return. Lauren let out a long, shaky breath, then turned away.<br> <br>Where the hell was her father? She&#x2019;d called him that morning and told him she was coming, and he&#x2019;d seemed fine. But according to the neighbors, who had sent numerous letters to her mother over the past three months, her father&#x2019;s Alzheimer&#x2019;s was getting worse. It was time for someone in the family to come back and take care of him. Her mother had refused. She&#x2019;d divorced Ned Jamison eleven years earlier, and she had no intention of reuniting with him now. David was back east at college. So Lauren had returned to Angel&#x2019;s Bay to deal with a man who was little more than a stranger to her. But he was still her father, and she needed to find him&#x2014;she just wasn&#x2019;t sure where to look. She had only spent a half dozen weekends with her dad since she&#x2019;d left home at seventeen, and all those visits had occurred in San Francisco. Where would he be on a Friday night? She didn&#x2019;t know who his friends were anymore, what he did, where he went.<br> <br>Or did she?<br> <br>Her father had always been a creature of habit. During her childhood, he&#x2019;d spent most of his time in three places: home, the bait and tackle shop he&#x2019;d run until two years ago, and his fishing boat <i>Leonora,</i> named after his great-great-great-grandmother who&#x2019;d been one of the founders of Angel&#x2019;s Bay.<br> <br>Lauren headed out the front door toward the marina, which was only a few blocks away. Buttoning up her sweater, she hurried down the street. It was seven o&#x2019;clock and there was already a chill in the darkening September sky. Soon there&#x2019;d be pumpkins and Halloween decorations on every porch, but for now the neighborhood was quiet.<br> <br>While some of the homes had been remodeled, the streets were very familiar. She&#x2019;d been born in Angel&#x2019;s Bay, and this neighborhood was where she&#x2019;d taken her first steps, learned to ride a bicycle, roller skated into the Johnsons&#x2019; rosebushes, gotten her first kiss in the moonlight, fallen in love . . . and fallen out of love.<br> <br>She blinked away the sudden moisture in her eyes and picked up her pace. She had a great life in San Francisco now, an interesting job and good friends, and she had no regrets about leaving her hometown. She just wished that she hadn&#x2019;t had to come back.<br> <br>By the time she reached Ocean Avenue, she was breathless. She quickened her pace as she passed the Angel&#x2019;s Heart Quilt Shop, where she and Abby and their mother had partaken in the town&#x2019;s longstanding tradition of community quilting. Quilting was the way mothers and daughters, sisters and friends connected the past with the present. She&#x2019;d once loved to quilt, but she hadn&#x2019;t picked up a needle and thread since she&#x2019;d left. She didn&#x2019;t want those connections anymore. Nor did she particularly want to see anyone she knew now. She was hoping to make her visit short, with as little community contact as possible.<br> <br>Crossing the street, she kept her head down as she passed Carl&#x2019;s Crab Shack. The line was out to the sidewalk and the delicious smells of clam chowder and fish and chips made her stomach rumble. She&#x2019;d done the four-hour drive from San Francisco without stopping for food but she couldn&#x2019;t stop now.<br> <br>As she reached the marina she saw a new sign on her father&#x2019;s bait and tackle shop, now called Brady&#x2019;s instead of Jamison&#x2019;s. The store was closed. She moved down the ramp that led to the boat slips. Luckily the gate had been propped open by a slat of wood, so she didn&#x2019;t need a key. Her father&#x2019;s old trawler had been moored at the second to last slip in the third row since she was a little girl. She hoped it was still there.<br> <br>The marina was quiet. Most of the action occurred in the early morning or late afternoon, when the sport and commercial fishermen were going out or coming back after a day of work or pleasure. Her pulse quickened as the lights on her father&#x2019;s boat suddenly came on, followed by the sound of an engine. She could see his silhouette in the cabin. What on earth was he doing? He couldn&#x2019;t go out to sea by himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad!&#x201d; she yelled, breaking into a run. She waved her arms as she screamed again, but either he couldn&#x2019;t hear her or he was ignoring her. By the time she reached the slip, her father&#x2019;s boat was chugging toward the middle of the bay. She had to stop him. She needed to call the Coast Guard or find someone to go after him. &#x201c;Hello! Anyone here?&#x201d; she called.<br> <br>A man emerged from a nearby boat and Lauren hurried down the dock.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>The familiar voice stopped her dead in her tracks, and as he jumped onto the dock and into the light, her heart skipped a beat.<br> <br>Shane. Shane Murray.<br> <br>He moved toward her with the same purposeful, determined step she remembered. She wasn&#x2019;t ready for this&#x2014;ready for him.<br> <br>She knew the split second that he recognized her. His step faltered, his shoulders stiffened, and his jaw set in a grim line. He didn&#x2019;t say her name. He just stared at her, waiting. Shane had never been one for words, he&#x2019;d always believed actions spoke louder than explanations. But sometimes the truth needed to be spoken&#x2014;not just implied or assumed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shane.&#x201d; She wished her voice didn&#x2019;t sound so husky, so filled with memories. She cleared her throat. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I need help. My father just took off in his boat. I don&#x2019;t know if you know, but he has Alzheimer&#x2019;s.&#x201d; She waved her hand toward the <i>Leonora,</i> whose lights were fading in the distance. &#x201c;I need to get him back. Will you help me? There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anyone else around.&#x201d; When he didn&#x2019;t answer right away, she added, &#x201c;I guess I could call the Coast Guard.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a moment she thought he might say no. They weren&#x2019;t friends anymore. If anything, they were enemies.<br> <br>Finally Shane gave a crisp nod. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; He headed back to his boat.<br> <br>The last thing she wanted to do was go with him, but she couldn&#x2019;t stand by while her father sailed off to sea with probably no idea of who he was or where he was going.<br> <br>Shane&#x2019;s boat was a newer thirty-foot sport fishing boat with all the modern conveniences. There were rod holders in the gunwales, tackle drawers and ice coolers built into the hull. As she stepped on board, Shane released the lines and pulled in the bumpers, then headed toward the center console. He started the engine and pulled out of the slip.<br> <br>She stood a few feet away, feeling awkward and uncomfortable. How long would it take before he&#x2019;d actually speak to her? And if he did, what would he say? There was a lot of painful history between them, and while part of her wanted him to break the silence, the other part was afraid of where that might lead.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d fallen for Shane just after her seventeenth birthday. He&#x2019;d been only a year older in age, but a half dozen in experience. She&#x2019;d been a shy good girl who&#x2019;d never done anything impulsive in her life, and he&#x2019;d been the town bad boy, moody, rebellious, and reckless. He&#x2019;d drawn her to him like a moth to a flame.<br> <br>Shane definitely wasn&#x2019;t a teenager anymore. In his faded blue jeans, gray T-shirt, and black jacket it was quite apparent that he was all man now. His six-foot frame had filled out with broad shoulders and long legs. His black hair was wavy and windblown, the ends brushing the collar of his jacket, and his skin bore the ruddy tan of a man who spent a lot of time outdoors.<br> <br>The set of his jaw had always been his &#x201c;no trespassing&#x201d; sign, and that hadn&#x2019;t changed a bit. Shane had never let people in easily. She&#x2019;d had to fight to get past his barriers, but even as close as they&#x2019;d been, she&#x2019;d never figured out the mysterious shadows in his dark eyes, or the sudden, sharp flashes of pain there. Shane had always kept a big part of himself under lock and key.<br> <br>Her gaze dropped to his hands, noting the sureness of his fingers on the wheel. His hands were strong and capable, and she couldn&#x2019;t help but remember the way they&#x2019;d once felt on her breasts&#x2014;rough and hungry, the same way his mouth had felt against hers, as if he couldn&#x2019;t wait to have her, couldn&#x2019;t ever get enough.<br> <br>Her heart thumped against her chest, and she forced herself to look away. She was <i>not</i> going back to that place. She&#x2019;d barely survived the first time. He&#x2019;d swept her off her feet, into a whirlwind of emotions, then broken her heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;It took you long enough to come home,&#x201d; Shane said finally. He glanced at her, his expression unreadable.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just came to get my dad. I&#x2019;m planning to take him back to San Francisco with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does he know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He will when we catch him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Doubt filled Shane&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Your father has lived in Angel&#x2019;s Bay his entire life. I can&#x2019;t see him moving anywhere else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His illness will only get worse. It&#x2019;s the best solution.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For you or for him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For both of us.&#x201d; Her father might not like the idea of leaving Angel&#x2019;s Bay, but it was the most practical decision. If she moved him closer to her she could take care of him, and perhaps her mother would help. His family was in San Francisco, and that&#x2019;s where he should be.<br> <br>Her dad hadn&#x2019;t cared to be with his family the past thirteen years, but she was trying to look beyond that fact. And if the neighbors were right, and her father was rapidly losing touch with the world&#x2014;would it really matter where he was?<br> <br>Shane opened a compartment and pulled out a jacket. &#x201c;You might want to put this on. It will get colder outside the bay.&#x201d;<br> <br>She accepted with a grateful nod, relieved with both the change in subject and the warm jacket. She&#x2019;d left San Francisco straight from work, wearing a navy blue skirt, silk blouse, thin sweater, and high-heeled pumps that were perfect for her job but offered no protection against the elements. Shane&#x2019;s big coat enveloped her like a warm hug, reminding her of the way she&#x2019;d once felt in his arms.<br> <br>She quickly pushed the thought out of her mind. &#x201c;So, this is a nice boat,&#x201d; she said into the increasingly awkward silence. &#x201c;Is it yours? Or is it part of the Murray charter fleet?&#x201d; Shane&#x2019;s father had run a charter fishing business for as long as Lauren could remember.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine. I picked it up last year when I came back,&#x201d; he said shortly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Came back from where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everywhere,&#x201d; he said with a vague wave. &#x201c;Wherever there was water and fish and a boat to run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds like you got the life you always wanted.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shot her a look that she couldn&#x2019;t begin to decipher. &#x201c;Is that what it sounds like, Lauren?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her name rolled off his tongue like a silky caress. She&#x2019;d always loved the way he&#x2019;d said her name, as if she were the most important person in the world. But that wasn&#x2019;t the way he&#x2019;d said her name now. Now there was anger in the word, and God knew what else.<br> <br>She sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to say to you, Shane. I guess I never did.&#x201d;<br> <br>His gaze hardened. &#x201c;You knew what to say, Lauren. You just wouldn&#x2019;t say it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Thirteen years ago he&#x2019;d wanted her to say that she believed in him, that she trusted him, that she knew in her heart that he hadn&#x2019;t killed her sister.<br> <br>All she&#x2019;d been able to say was good-bye.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about the past.&#x201d; The words had barely left her lips when she found herself compelled to speak again. &#x201c;You lied to me, Shane. I trusted you more than I&#x2019;d ever trusted anyone, and you lied to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave a little nod, his eyes dark and unreadable. &#x201c;Yeah, I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re still not going to tell me why, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t want to talk about the past.&#x201d;<br> <br>She debated that. There were so many things she wanted Shane to explain, but what was the point?<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right; it won&#x2019;t change anything. In the end, Abby&#x2014;Abby will still be gone.&#x201d; A chill ran through her, and she glanced at the coastline. It was too dark to see the Ramsay house, where her sister had been found murdered, but she could feel its presence even if she couldn&#x2019;t see it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone set fire to the house about nine months ago,&#x201d; Shane said, following her gaze. &#x201c;One wing was destroyed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too bad the house didn&#x2019;t burn to the ground.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d never understood how her father could stay in Angel&#x2019;s Bay, could wake up every day and see the house where her sister had spent the last violent minutes of her life. But there were a lot of things she couldn&#x2019;t understand about her dad.<br> <br>Lauren grabbed hold of the back of the captain&#x2019;s seat as Shane increased their speed. On the open sea, waves slapped against the boat and the wind increased, lifting her hair off the back of her neck. Her nerves began to tingle with fear. She could handle being on the water when the day was sunny and bright and she could see the shoreline, but she&#x2019;d never liked going out at night, or being hours away from land, where she&#x2019;d be vulnerable, at the mercy of the unpredictable sea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is my father?&#x201d; Panic made her voice rise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any lights. How are we going to find him out here? Maybe we should go back.&#x201d; She hated being a coward, especially in front of Shane, who had never felt a fear he didn&#x2019;t want to meet head on.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father didn&#x2019;t disappear. He&#x2019;s just around the bluff.&#x201d; Shane pointed to the GPS on his console. &#x201c;See that dot&#x2014;that&#x2019;s him. We&#x2019;ll catch up in a couple of minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Good.&#x201d; She gulped in a deep breath of air and wrapped her arms around her waist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you scared of me?&#x201d; Shane sent her a speculative look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You seem nervous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to get this over with.&#x201d;<br> <br>A few minutes passed, then Shane said, &#x201c;Your father loves this town. Do you really think you can drop in after all this time and sweep him away without an argument?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to do <i>something</i>. When I arrived at his house tonight, the stove was on. He could have burned the house down. And who knows where he&#x2019;s headed now?&#x201d; She shook her head in ...</p><h2>Horary Astrology</h2><p>The technique of immediacies, with a primer of Symbolism. 1975 clean bright copy</p><p></p><h2>Starfist: Wings of Hell</h2><p>Planet Haulover has been invaded by Skinks.

He recently retired from his work as an analyst for the Department of Defense.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Captain Lew Conorado, the commander of Company L of the infantry battalion of Thirty-fourth Fleet Initial Strike Team, settled into the chair behind the desk in his office and sighed. A thought crossed his mind: his wife, Marta. He shrugged it off. Let him finish the little bit of work he still had to do, then he could think of Marta. Better, he could go home to her.<br><br>He was at his desk, in his office. It felt like a long time since he'd last been there. And it had been a long time, as deployments go. In a normal forty-year career, a Marine might have a couple of dozen deployments, many involving combat. But only one or two of them would be actual wars. He thought back to the war on Diamunde, which had been his first war. It hadn't lasted as long as the later war on Kingdom, his second war. And now he was back from his third war, which was even longer than the one on Kingdom.<br><br>Three wars in less than ten years. He couldn't help but think that if Thirty-fourth Fleet Initial Strike Team hadn't been quarantined, he would have long since been transferred to a different posting and wouldn't have gone to either Kingdom or Ravenette. Maybe. Maybe there would have been other wars he would have gone to. He was sure there had to have been other operations involving Marines and army units acting together during that time, operations that counted as wars. He might have lost as many of his Marines on those operations as he had on the ones he'd actually fought in.<br><br>That's what was bothering him, what made sitting at his desk in his office in Marine Corps Base, Camp Major Pete Ellis, on Thorsfinni's World, feel so good. For the foreseeable future, he wasn't going to lose any more Marines.<br><br>He shook himself, because that kind of thinking could turn morbid in a hurry. It was better to think of what he still had to do before he could leave his office to go home, to where Marta waited for him, and begin the five days' liberty on which he'd already released his Marines.<br><br>The Marines had been debriefed on the voyage home from Ravenette, and Brigadier Sturgeon had already had his end-of-mission commanders' call, at which the FIST commander informed his unit commanders that the Confederation Ministry of Defense was striking a medal for the just-completed mission against the rebellious Coalition-which was only to be expected. He smiled to himself; Ensign Charlie Bass hadn't been informed yet, but the brigadier had told Conorado privately that at the awards ceremony following the liberty, Bass was going to be promoted to lieutenant. Nothing morbid in that thought. And Conorado liked the idea of not notifying Bass in advance.<br><br>The only thing he saw that couldn't wait a few days was Lance Corporal Francisco Ymenez, who had come in from Whiskey Company as a replacement when Lance Corporal MacIlargie was wounded on Ravenette and was still with the platoon as a temporary replacement. Ymenez wanted to stay with the platoon when MacIlargie returned to duty, and Bass wanted to keep him. But when MacIlargie and Lance Corporal Longfellow, the two men still recovering from wounds, returned there wouldn't be any open slots in the platoon for Ymenez to fill. It would be unconscionable for Conorado to leave the lance corporal dangling. He looked at the company roster.<br><br>And found he couldn't think straight. Marta was too much on his mind to allow him cogent thought. Anyway, personnel shuffling was the first sergeant's job. Figuring out how to shuffle people to allow Bass to keep Ymenez could wait a few days.<br><br>On the off chance that Ymenez was still on base, Conorado checked the location of his men. Ymenez was still in the barracks, almost the only one who hadn't yet taken off on liberty. Conorado told Corporal Palmer, the company chief clerk, who also hadn't yet left on liberty, to summon Ymenez.<br><br>Ymenez must have run from third platoon's squadbay, because less than a minute later Palmer announced him.<br><br>"Enter," Conorado commanded.<br><br>"Sir, Lance Corporal Ymenez reporting as ordered!" Ymenez said, as he stepped up to Conorado's desk and stood at rigid attention.<br><br>"At ease, Lance Corporal."<br><br>Ymenez shifted to parade rest.<br><br>"Ensign Bass tells me you want to stay in his platoon, that you'd rather not go back to Whiskey Company. Is that so?"<br><br>"Yes, sir. I'd like to stay with third platoon, sir."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Sir? B-because third platoon is a damn fine platoon. And Ensign Bass is just about the best officer I've ever served under. Sir."<br><br>Conorado nodded. "Ensign Bass thinks you're an asset to the platoon. No promises, but I'll see what I can do. If possible, you'll get your wish. Now, Lance Corporal, liberty call has been sounded. Why are you still in the barracks?" He gave Ymenez a quick once-over. "Your garrison utilities are clean and your insignia is on right, head for Bronnys and enjoy yourself with the rest of the platoon." And let me get home to Marta.<br><br>A grin splashed across Ymenez's face as he snapped back to attention. "Aye aye, sir! Thank you, sir!" He executed a sharp about-face and marched out of the company commander's office. He was running by the time he hit the corridor outside the company office.<br><br>"Palmer, what are you still doing here?" Conorado demanded, leaving his office.<br><br>"Waiting to make sure there's nothing I have to do before I head for liberty, sir."<br><br>"Everything's done. Now get out of here so I can leave; my wife is waiting for me."<br><br>"Aye aye, sir." Palmer grinned. He locked his comp and preceded Conorado out of the office.<br><br>Most of the enlisted men of Company L, like the Marines of the rest of Thirty-fourth FIST, had headed just outside Camp Ellis's main gate, to Bronnoysund, for their five-day liberty. Most of the Marines of third platoon headed straight for Big Barb's, the combination ship's chandlery, hotel, bar, and bordello where every one of them could be found at one hour or another on any given day (or night) of shore liberty.<br><br>They were, as usual, greeted with boisterous enthusiasm when they entered Big Barb's. And a lot of joyful squeals from Big Barb's girls.<br><br>"Te-em!" The synchronized squeal wasn't the first, but it certainly cut through the others. Two lovely young women, one as dark as the other was fair, burst through the others crowding the Marines and hurtled onto Sergeant Tim Kerr, the second squad leader.<br><br>Unlike the last time Thirty-fourth FIST had returned from a deployment, when Frida and Gotta had almost knocked him off his feet with their greeting, Kerr was ready for them and braced himself for the onslaught.<br><br>Other young women threw themselves at the Marines:<br><br>The one called Erika cried, "Raoul!" and jumped off the lap of the farmer she'd been sweet-talking and encouraging to drink up; she ran to Corporal Raoul Pasquin, abandoning her farmer.<br><br>Carlala, long-haired and almost painfully thin, was coming down the stairs from the private rooms when the Marines came through the door. She nearly jumped over the banister in her haste to reach Corporal Joe Dean.<br><br>Corporal Dornhofer was blindsided when a voluptuous young woman named Klauda darted up behind and jumped on his back without crying out his name.<br><br>Corporal Chan saw statuesque Sigfreid barreling through the room, and ran to meet her head-on, acting on the theory that if he had enough momentum going when they collided, she wouldn't knock him to the floor. Considering how much bigger she was than he, that could be a serious issue.<br><br>Svelte Hildegard hadn't paired off with any particular one of the Marines in the past. She sashayed into the crowd and pressed herself against Lance Corporal Isadore Godenov. "Come here often?" she purred into his ear, then laughed so hard she almost doubled over. When she was able to stand straight, she managed so say, "That's such a dumb line, but I can't help it; I've wanted to say it for so long." Then she was laughing hard again. When she regained control she asked, "Seriously, Izzy, would you like some companionship?" Godenov looked at Hildegard's still-red face with tears on her cheeks. He was straining to hold back his own laughter, so he merely nodded. She took his hand and led him to a large table where some of the other third platoon Marines were already congregating with their girls.<br><br>Sergeant Ratliff, first squad leader, turned with a sharp retort on his tongue when a voice said into his ear, "Buy a girl a drink, sailor?" He swallowed the retort; it was Kona. Kona wasn't one of Big Barb's girls, she was a young widow from the village of Hryggurandlit who had come to the big party thrown for the Marines on their return from the war on Kingdom. She hadn't gone to the party looking to do anything in particular, and certainly she hadn't been looking for a man. But during the course of events she had found herself paired off with Sergeant Lupo Ratliff. And subsequently found that she actually liked him. She said, "I heard the FIST was back. Thought I'd like to see you again." She cocked her head. "And I hoped you'd like to see me again."<br><br>Ratliff gave her an exaggerated stern look. "I ain't no squid, lady. You take that back, and yes, I'd love to buy you a drink."<br><br>She reached out a hand and caressed his cheek. "I'd love to have a drink with you, Marine."<br><br>"Vat's goink on here!" All eyes turned to the booming voice. It was Big Barb Banak herself, the owner of Big Barb's, plowing her way through the crowded common room like an icebreaker through pack ice, heading unerringly toward the men of third platoon.<br><br>"Timmy," she roared when she reached the table, "you still beink greedy, you godda hab two girls?"<br><br>Before Kerr could answer, Gotta stuck her tongue out at Big Barb, and Frida shouted, "You gave him to us, and we are keeping him. So there!"<br><br>Big Barb snorted. Then she saw the sergeant's stripes on Kerr's shirt collars. "Who got kilt?" she gasped, searching the faces of the Marines of third platoon, looking for who wasn't there. "Vhere's Rat?"<br><br>Kerr shook his head. "Sergeant Linsman was killed."<br><br>"Ant you vas bromoted to tage his blace?"<br><br>Kerr nodded.<br><br>Big Barb continued searching the faces. "Vot aboud Billy?"<br><br>Corporal Orest Kindrachuck thumbed the chevrons on his collars. "I was promoted to replace him," he said in a thick voice.<br><br>"Glaypoole, Volfman, Longfeller, dey det too?"<br><br>Ratliff, as senior man present, answered her. "Claypoole's fine, he went off on his own. MacIlargie and Longfellow are in the hospital, but they'll be back with us soon." He paused, then continued, "They were too new. I don't think you had a chance to get to know them. PFC Smedley and PFC Delagarza were also killed."<br><br>"Ach min Gud," Big Barb muttered. She vaguely remembered Smedley, but the name Delagarza meant nothing to her. "Too many, too many det young men. Alla time, too many." She shook herself-and when Big Barb shook her hundreds of kilos it was something to see-and stood erect. "Vell, you're back. Enchoy yourselfs." She gave the Marines another look, and blinked. "Vat you doink here?" she squawked at a pretty young girl called Stulka, who was sitting on the lap of PFC John Three McGinty.<br><br>Stulka jumped, and whipped her arms from around McGinty's neck to her lap. "I'm, I'm just, I'm helping the other girls." Stulka was the youngest of Big Barb's girls, and mostly waited tables and helped out in the kitchen.<br><br>"You don' godda do dat, you know."<br><br>"But the other girls are always saying how much fun they have with third platoon. I just want to have fun."<br><br>Big Barb gave Stulka a penetrating look. "Hokay," she finally agreed. Vhy nod, she thought as she waddled away. Da girl mags more money for me dat vay.<br><br>Einna Orafem spun about to snap at her staff when the normal clatter of the kitchen at Big Barb's suddenly went silent. But whatever she'd been about to say was forgotten the instant she saw the reason her staff had abruptly gone still and quiet; she stood gaping open- mouthed at Lance Corporal Dave "Hammer" Schultz, who stood just inside the kitchen doors, looking at her. To everyone in the kitchen except her, Schultz's expression was a glower that promised sudden, violent death. To Einna Orafem, Schultz's look was one of tender passion and love.<br><br>She slowly closed her mouth, and her lips moved in the shape of his name, though she didn't have the breath to speak it.<br><br>The big Marine lifted a hand and pointed a crooked finger at her. That broke her paralysis, and she screamed and ran to him, flinging herself into his arms and throwing her legs around his waist with enough force to stagger even the big man.<br><br>The Big Barb's kitchen staff ogled their tyrannical boss and exchanged disbelieving glances at the way she rained wet kisses all over Schultz's face, emitting squeaks and squeals as she did. Schultz did the manly thing, stoically accepting the kisses and clasping his hands under her buttocks to hold her up. There was no way of telling how long Einna Orafem would have continued blubbering over Schultz if she hadn't been interrupted when Big Barb herself burst through the door.<br><br>"Vat's goink on in here?" Big Barb bellowed in a voice that could stampede a herd of kwangduks, and did rattle crockery. "Dis is a vorkblace! I don' hear no sounts of vork! You!"-she smacked Schultz on the seat of his pants with a crack that echoed off the kitchen walls-"Unhant dat voman! She's my cook, she's got vork to do!"<br><br>Einna Orafem wrapped her arms tightly around Schultz's neck and pressed her cheek into his, glaring at her employer. She snarled at Big Barb in the same tone she'd been about to use on her staff before she lost her voice, "My Hammer's back from war. I'm off duty!"<br><br>"Sez who?" Big Barb demanded, stepping close to shove her face at her chief cook. "You tink you can get anodder chob easy?"<br><br>"Go ahead, fire me! I'll get a job cooking in the mess hall at Camp Ellis. Then see what happens to your business when the Marines decide to eat there instead of here!"<br><br>The two women glared at each other for a long moment before Big Barb reared back and roared out a laugh that would have stampeded a distant herd of kwangduks, and did knock a few pots off stoves.<br><br>She beamed at Einna Orafem and patted her on the cheek. "You got spirit, girl. I like dat in a voman." She stepped around to face Schultz and wagged a sausagelike finger in his face. "Don' you hurd her. An I vant her back in time for domorrow's dinner. You unnerstan?"<br><br>Schultz rumbled something that Big Barb took to mean, "I promise not to hurt her, and I'll have her back in time for tomorrow's dinner."<br><br>"Gut. Now da two a' you gid outta here, you distracting da res' a' da peoples." She spun about, glaring at the kitchen staff. "Who tol' you ta stop vorkink? You god meals ta cook, hungry peoples ta feed. Gid back to vork!"</p><h2>Mirror of the Marvelous: The Classic Surrealist Work on Myth</h2><p>The first English translation of one of the most significant works of the surrealist movement that looks at the great mythic themes as they appear in both classic and modern literature.<p></p><p><br>� Long considered one of the most significant and original books to have come out of the surrealist movement</p><p><br>� Cites ancient epics, modern poems, creation myths, and contemporary visions of the apocalypse in an active attempt to define the creative flame of the marvelous&nbsp; </p><p><br><i>The Mirror of the Marvelous</i> has long been considered one of the most significant and original books to have come out of the surrealist movement.

The result is a decade&#39;s worth of truly monumental cinema, from Hitchcock masterpieces (Vertigo, Psycho, Rear Window) to comedy classics (Tati&#39;s Mr. Hulot&#39;s Holiday, Billy Wilder&#39;s Some Like it Hot) to groundbreaking nouvelle vague films (Godard&#39;s Breathless, Truffaut&#39;s The Four Hundred Blows) and profound, innovative dramas such as Antonioni&#39;s L?Avventura, Fellini&#39;s La Strada, John Huston&#39;s Misfits, and Kubrick&#39;s Paths of Glory. Though censorship kept sex safely off-screen, sexy stars such as James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Marilyn Monroe provided plenty of heat in Rebel Without a Cause, A Streetcar Named Desire, and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes respectively.

Harris was born in Eatonton, Georgia, where he served as an apprentice on a plantation during his teenage years. He spent most of his adult life in Atlanta working as an associate editor at the Atlanta Constitution. Harris led two professional lives: as the editor and journalist known as Joe Harris, he supported a vision of the New South with the editor Henry W. Grady (1880-1889), stressing regional and racial reconciliation after the Reconstruction era. As Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, he wrote many &#39;Brer Rabbit&#39; stories from the African-American oral tradition and helped to revolutionize literature in the process. James Weldon Johnson called the Uncle Remus collection &#34;the greatest body of folklore America has produced.&#34;</p><h2>Networking Like a Pro: Turning Contacts into Connections</h2><p><p><b>Master the Art of Networking!</b></p> <p>Networking expert and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Dr. Ivan Misner along with David Alexander, and Brian Hilliard reveal key networking techniques to help you grow your business.

The Hell Girl will appear to drag your tormentor to eternal damnation. But you will have to pay a price . . . your soul!</p><p>Enter your enemy's name at midnight on a special Web site, and Hell Girl takes revenge on them for you. Each chapter is thus a story of someone getting what's coming to them. The most fully realized, in both motivation and setup, is the first. Nerd Mari is set up to be caught shoplifting; popular Satsuki rescues her but blackmails Mari into buying her treats. Later stories cover a pastry student opening her own shop sabotaged by her jealous former teacher; an aspiring actress starring in the Hell Girl movie who's being stalked; an evil vet; and a girl sexually harassed by her teacher. As the book proceeds, the stories and resolutions become more perfunctory. It can be difficult to tell which character is speaking, given the lack of tails on the word balloons, since the voices aren't distinctive. The action is also unclear in key scenes, with too many shortcuts taken. Hell, by the way, looks like a shower of black chrysanthemums, the Japanese funeral flower. Those wishing evil are told that in return for their enemy's condemnation, they too will go to hell after they die, but that warning is little played up in this anime tie-in that probably plays better on TV. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Was it precipitated by the <em>Zeitgeist </em>prevailing in Europe, so that there would have been a religious upheaval even if Luther or Zwingli had died in their cradles? Was the Reformation an authentically religious phenomenon, or the result of certain political, social, or economic developments? Was it 'medievil' or 'modern' in its orientation? What was the teaching of the Reformers? What was the significance of the Reformation? The measure of scholarly agreement with respect to these questions differs; far from offering definitive answers, we can here only call attention to their persistent presence....</p><p>"When the reformers who had first ventured a new interpretation of the gospel had passed from the scene, the question which had haunted the Reformation from its very inception--where is truth?--was still contested by the proponents of the old and the new faith. But one fact was beyond dispute: Western Christendom was tragically divided...into no less than five [religious factions]....Though these divisions were the result of intense religious conviction, they could not help but lessen the intensity of religious belief in Europe. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was the last period in the history of Western civilization when men were preoccupied with religion, argued it, fought and even died for it. Its consequences are still with us." --Hans J. Hillerbrand</p></p><p>This collection of important primary sources pertaining to the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century has had an amazingly persistent history. Originally published some 40 years ago, it still enjoys the confidence of students of the Reformation. In contrast to most other source collections, The Protestant Reformation offered lengthy excerpts from important primary sources, rather than short snippets, so as to provide the reader with an understanding of the broader cogency and dynamic of an author&#39;s arguments. However, since the time of the original publication, the study of the Reformation of the sixteenth century has taken several important turns that have revised or changed the traditional understanding. Accordingly, these new perspectives need to be noted. This new edition seeks to accommodate these new trends and perspectives while retaining the basic orientation of the original edition. It includes texts written by women as well as texts dealing with popular religion. Its basic assumption, however, continues to be that religion - no matter how variously dependent on societal forces--must be seen as the pivotal element in the story of the sixteenth century.<p>Hans J. Hillerbrand is the former chair of the department of religion at Duke University. A recognized expert on the Reformation and the history of modern Christianity, he has published many articles and books on the period and was the editor in chief of <em>The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation</em>. He is the former president of both the American Academy of Religion and the American Society of Church History, and he lives in Durham, North Carolina.</p></p><h2>The Sounds of People and Places</h2><p>The new edition of this popular classroom anthology brings together the best recent essays by distinguished geographers on region, music and their interrelatedness. While emphasizing the regional nature of American music, the book introduces geographical concepts such as location factors, spatial organization, distribution, and diffusion. The study follows the paths of four types of American folk and popular music: gospel, country, jazz, and rock from their origins to their geographic centers. The contributors include Thomas Arkell, R.W. Butler, James R. Curtis, Larry Ford, Jon A. Glasgow, Charles F. Gritzner, A.D.

Intense but not disturbing.</p><p>Considering Law &amp; Order's popularity, over 88 million viewers watch it and its spinoffs and reruns each week, the dearth of books about the show is fairly surprising. This literary tribute, divided neatly into three sections, is more than a fetishist's bedside companion. Wolf, the show's creator, offers a brisk introduction, setting the tone with some revealing background tidbits (e.g., Wolf and his colleagues chose a bifurcated format for the show so it could be syndicated as either a half-hour or full-hour show). "Anatomy of a Crime Scene," by far the most revealing section, takes a 2002 episode, "Oxymoron," and explains how it came together, bit by bit. Wolf gives everyone e.g., the police technical consultant, the executive producer, the actor playing a corpse (she was paid $161 for the day's work)a few crisp, concise paragraphs to explain their contributions. The "Scenes of the Crime" portion shares photos of the central crime scenes (taken by Burstein, the show's still photographer). While some of the images are too obviously composed, most are impossible to distinguish from real crime scene shots. The book's final section, "In the Criminal Justice System," which gives a loving overview of the show's major players (including Paul Sorvino, Angie Harmon and Jerry Orbach), is, while good enough, probably for serious fans only, as casual readers may not be as interested in learning, for example, why the character Detective Sergeant Phil Cerreta is a snappy dresser. Altogether, this is a simple, classy and authoritative gift book.

In classic Western style Larry McMurtry illustrates the timeless conflict between the modernity and the Old West through the eyes of Texas cattlemen.<br><br><i>Horseman, Pass By</i> tells the story of Homer Bannon, an old-time cattleman who epitomizes the frontier values of honesty and decency, and Hud, his unscrupulous stepson. Caught in the middle is the narrator, Homer's young grandson Lonnie, who is as much drawn to his grandfather&#x2019;s strength of character as he is to Hud's hedonism and materialism. <br> <br>When first published in 1961, <i>Horseman, Pass By</i> caused a sensation in Texas literary circles for its stark, realistic portrayal of the struggles of a changing West in the years following World War II. Never before had a writer managed to encapsulate its environment with such unsentimental realism.

In this book, Simonetta Carr informs readers about Owen s life, revealing some of the things that interested him while in school, the care he showed to people when he became a pastor, and the influential books that he wrote. Readers will also come to understand the difficult times in which Owen lived, and how he handled the terrors of war and religious persecution. Full of illustrations and fascinating information, this is an ideal way for young readers to learn history. <b>Finalist at the 2011 San Diego Book Awards</b></p><p>Simonetta Car was born in Italy and has lived and worked in different cultures. A former elementary school teacher, she has home-schooled her eight children for many years. She has written for newspapers and magazines around the world and has translated the works of several Christian authors into Italian. Presently, she lives in San Diego with her husband Thomas and family. She is a member and Sunday School teacher at Christ United Reformed Church.<p> <b>Illustrator</b> <br> Matt Abraxas has traveled from California to France, studying different approaches to art. He enjoys creating and teaching art, and currently exhibits his work at the SmithKlein Gallery in Boulder Colorado. Matt lives with his wife Rebecca and two sons, Zorba and Rainer, in Lafayette, Colorado.</p>Simonetta Carr's book on John Owen is a delightful introduction to his life for the very young. In the tradition of her earlier books on Calvin and Augustine, she retells Owen's story with flair and passion, and accompanies it with great illustrations which help to make his life and times vivid and exciting. Heartily commended! --Carl Trueman<br><br>Simonetta Carr's wonderful biography of John Owen is the third book in what I hope will be a growing collection of biographies of Christian heroes. In clear, unembellished language Carr chronicles the life of the Prince of Puritans through a tumultuous period of English history. This book manages to be simple without being shallow. Young readers will admire the integrity of Owen's conscience as a man living in a difficult time and relish the rich descriptions of Owen's theological genius. This is a masterful book. I trust that many others will follow. --Tedd Tripp<br><br>Owen was, and remains, a very important teacher of God's ways, and it is good to introduce young people to him. --J.I.

Bodie's goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life. Reading opened the world to me. I began to write stories of my own." </p> <p>By the young age of fourteen, Bodie had a job as a stringer reporter for The California Newspaper. "They paid me fifty cents an inch for one article a week. The most I ever made was twelve dollars, but I felt rich!"</p> <p>Bodie continued her college education as a Journalism-Political Science major in San Jose, California. She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches."</p> <p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!"</p> <p>Publication of <i>The Fall Guy</i> catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim. Shortly after that she went to work for John Wayne's Batjac Productions and ABC Television as a writer and researcher, working with the top writers in the motion picture industry.

Her work is currently featured in <i>American West, Saturday Evening Post, </i>and <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine, as well as other national publications. </p> <p>Bodie's interest in Israel, which culminated in THE ZION CHRONICLES, stems from her days as a student. In 1978 she spoke to John Wayne about her hope to one day write a novel about the exciting events surrounding the rebirth of Israel. He encouraged her with his reply: "That's one you ought to do. It's the story of the Jewish Alamo!"</p> <p>With the publication of the first book in THE ZION CHRONICLES <i>The Gates of Zion</i> she was awarded the Gold Medallion Book Award by the ECPA.</p><p></p><p>Raised in a Christian home, <b>Brock Thoene</b> tells people that he began going to church even before he was born!

Having accepted the Lord as his Savior at the age of seven, he came to a new understanding of the work of the Holy Spirit through the ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ while he was in college.

But now she must decide if she truly belongs in the Amish world...</b><br><br>Unexpected tragedy has left Hannah without her soldier husband and a home for her baby son, Jamie. Seeking refuge, she comes to live with her aunt in Pleasant Valley, a place she hasn&#x2019;t seen since childhood, when her parents left the Mennonite faith. Working in her aunt&#x2019;s bakery is a way for Hannah to get back on her feet, but she isn&#x2019;t sure if she can live by tradition&#x2014;or if she and Jamie should stay for good. She finds an unexpected sympathetic listener in furniture maker William Brand. His stutter makes him feel like a permanent outsider in his Amish community, and he understands her loneliness.&nbsp;<br><br>Hannah is irresistibly drawn to the shy, caring William, and her education in speech therapy makes it natural for her to want to help him speak more easily. But how can she encourage his attention when she might someday leave Pleasant Valley, and when her father-in-law, a military officer, is scheming to take Jamie away from her? As William seeks the courage to stand up for the woman who believes in him, Hannah must decide where her true home lies&#x2014;in the free, ever-changing world she knows, or in the simpler, loving community she&#x2019;s found...</p><p>A lifetime spent in rural Pennsylvania and her own Pennsylvania Dutch roots led <b>Marta Perry</b> to write about the Plain People who add to the rich heritage of her home state. She is the author of more than fifty inspirational romance novels, including the Pleasant Valley series and the Keepers of the Promise trilogy. She lives with her husband in a century-old farmhouse.<p>Chapter One</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A man in army fatigues stepped off a bus just down the street at the Pleasant Valley bus stop. Hannah Conroy clutched the stroller handle as an onslaught of dizziness hit her. She fought the irrational surge of joy that turned in an instant to ashes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't Travis. It was a stranger, a young soldier, moving into the welcoming arms of his family-mother holding him, fighting back tears; father standing stiffly as if to deny his emotions; a girl of about ten waving a welcome sign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not Travis. Travis had lain beneath a marker in Arlington National Cemetery for well over a year. He wasn't here on a warm September day in Pleasant Valley.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two women in Plain dress stopped next to her on the sidewalk, their faces blurred by the tears she wouldn't let fall. One reached out a tentative hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you all right? You are Hannah, ain't so? Paula Schatz's niece?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She nodded. She couldn't cry. Jamie would be frightened if he saw his mother in tears. But he was almost asleep in the stroller, one chubby hand still grasping his toy dog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm fine." Hannah almost managed a smile. "Thank you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're going into the bakery, ja? Let us help you get the stroller inside."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The woman motioned to the other . . . a girl in her early teens, Hannah saw now . . . who pulled the door open, setting the bell jangling. Together they maneuvered the stroller into Aunt Paula's bakery, where the aroma of fresh-baked bread surrounded her, easing the hurt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you," she said again. The grief and pain ebbed, leaving her as lost as a leaf in the wind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's nothing." The woman patted her arm with a feather-light touch, the girl nodded, and they were gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Paula, as round and comforting as one of her own dumplings, glanced up from the customer she was serving, her eyes clouding when she saw Hannah's face. By the time Hannah reached the kitchen door, Aunt Paula was there, wiping her hands on the white apron she wore over her traditional Old Order Mennonite dress, its tiny print faded from many washings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hannah? Was ist letz?" Aunt Paula spoke English most of the time, but in moments of stress she was apt to slip into Pennsylvania Dutch. "What's wrong? I saw Leah Glick and her daughter helping you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nothing." Hannah bent, the action hiding her face for a moment, and lifted Jamie from the stroller. He was relaxed and drowsy, a precious, heavy armload now at twenty months. "I'm fine."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She didn't want Aunt Paula worrying about her. It was enough that her aunt had made a home here for her and Jamie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Hannah couldn't stop herself from glancing at the window. The family, their faces animated with love, moved toward a car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Paula followed her gaze. "Ach, I see." Her voice was soft. "I know. After your uncle passed, I'd see a man with wavy hair like his, or his way of walking, and my heart would stop, as if it reacted faster than my brain did."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been almost a year and a half." Hannah cradled Jamie close, and he snuggled his face into her shoulder, his soft breath against her neck. "I'm better. But sometimes-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ja. Sometimes." Aunt Paula patted her. "I know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bell jingled on the bakery door, and Aunt Paula turned to greet the man in Amish garb. In all the years since she'd lived here as a child, Hannah had nearly forgotten the peculiar mix of Amish, horse-and-buggy Mennonite, black bumper Mennonite, and English that made Pleasant Valley so unique.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>William Brand was Amish, and he worked with his cousin Caleb in the cabinetry shop down the street. Hannah had learned that much from him, but it had taken persistence. William stuttered, and like many stutterers, he took refuge in silence much of the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Banishing thoughts of the past, Hannah moved to the counter, smiling. William was silent enough already. She didn't want him to think she was avoiding speaking to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good morning."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He ducked his head in a nod. Tall for an Amish man, and broad-shouldered, he wore the traditional Amish black broadfall trousers with a blue shirt and suspenders, the usual straw hat on his head. In his midtwenties, William was probably a year or two younger than she was, but his fresh color and the shyness in his blue eyes made him seem even younger. Next to him, she felt ancient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And what did he make of her, with her denim skirt, pink lipstick, and curling ponytail? Did he find it odd that Paula Schatz had such a modern niece?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"H-H-Hannah," he managed, as if determined to say her name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then he looked at her son, and his face softened. He held out a work-roughened hand, and Jamie latched on to it, saying something that might have been an attempt at William's name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"S-sleepy time, Jamie?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie shook his head vigorously, but the movement was interrupted by a huge yawn that showed every one of his baby teeth, and they both laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Funny, how William's stutter seemed to ease when he spoke to Jamie. Once, a lifetime ago, she'd planned to become a speech therapist, and her interest stirred at the observation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He just doesn't want to admit he's tired. I thought he was going to fall asleep in the stroller," she said, reminding herself to speak naturally to William. Talking with a stutterer required more patience than many people had.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"H-h-he's a-afraid he'll m-m-miss something."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's for sure." She tickled Jamie's belly, loving the way he chuckled, eyes crinkling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Paula returned to the counter, carrying two coffees in foam cups and a white bag. "There you are, William, your usual coffee, just the way you and Caleb like it. And a couple of crullers to tide you over until lunch."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"D-d-denke."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He handed her the money. With another smile for Jamie, he went out quickly, perhaps relieved not to have to engage in any further conversation. His straw hat shielded his face from Hannah's view as he passed the window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She stood watching his tall figure for a moment, and then went to get Jamie's plastic cup of milk from the small refrigerator behind the counter. She focused her mind on him, trying not to let it stray toward those moments on the sidewalk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Has William always stuttered?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aunt Paula leaned against the display case, seeming ready for a comfortable gossip. "I don't know about always. You don't remember the Brands from when you were growing up?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She shook her head. "I was only nine when we left, after all." She handed Jamie the cup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course Aunt Paula knew that. How could Paula forget when her beloved younger sister had up and left the community, left the church, left her family, and incidentally left behind all Hannah's security?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No reason you should, I guess," Aunt Paula said. "Anyway, it's a big family, and William is the youngest. His mamm and daad were both sickly off and on, and it seemed like William kind of got lost in the shuffle, what with his oldest brother, Isaac, taking over the farm and always barking orders at the younger ones. I'm not sure when the stuttering started, but it was before William went to school."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah nodded, feeling a pang of sympathy. William hadn't had it easy. "That's typical. It's usually in those early years when a child is starting to talk. How did the family handle it? Did they get help for him?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not that I know of." Aunt Paula frowned. "I think the schoolteacher tried to help him, but seems like the other kinder were always impatient, finishing his sentences for him, acting like he was . . . well, slow."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't think he's that." She'd seen quick understanding in William's face in their few conversations, even when he didn't speak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ach, William's bright enough, and the best thing that could have happened to him was going to work with his cousin Caleb in the shop. He's got a gift with his hands, so Caleb says, and Caleb's a master woodworker himself, so he'd know. The boy will maybe find a little respect for himself there."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not a boy," Hannah murmured, taking the cup from Jamie, who was nearly asleep on her shoulder. She rubbed his back, cherishing the feel of his small warm body against her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, you're right. He's not." Aunt Paula touched Jamie's brown curls in a quick caress. "William seems younger than he is, no doubt because of the stutter."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah nodded, moving toward the stairs that led up to the apartment above the shop. She would put Jamie in his crib and-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm nearly forgetting." Aunt Paula's voice lifted. "That's what you were studying in college, wasn't it? Before you got married, I mean?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Speech therapy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd gotten interested when she'd babysat for a family with a child who stuttered. The Davises had been so helpful, encouraging her and aiding her with loan applications so she could go to school. That had been her only goal, until Travis came along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Travis had loved her. It had seemed meant to be, that they should love each other and get married and make a home together always.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always hadn't lasted very long. Just a few short years of moving from one army base to another. She'd been pregnant when his unit shipped out to Afghanistan. Travis had never seen his son, and she'd quickly learned that a mother with a young child and an incomplete education had very little chance of making a home of any kind, even with the military's death benefits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You could help William." Aunt Paula, not able to follow Hannah's thoughts, smiled broadly. "I don't know why I didn't think of that before. You can teach William, help him get over his stutter."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, no, I couldn't," she said quickly. "I'm not qualified. I never finished school, and besides-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, you're as near to qualified as William is likely to get," Aunt Paula said briskly. "It would be an act of charity to help him." She said it as if that were the defining argument, as it probably was to anyone brought up Mennonite, accustomed as they were to the idea of service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Hannah hadn't been Mennonite since she was a child, and as much as she'd like to help, her instincts told her it was a bad idea to get involved in William's problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I really don't-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just think about it." Aunt Paula patted her shoulder. "You'll see I'm right. It would be good for you, too, to make use of your education."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah hesitated, but then she nodded. Agreeing to think about it was easy. Marshaling the arguments against it was more difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Especially since she didn't want to use the strongest one-that she intended to go back to the outside world as soon as she could swing it financially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The familiar worry settled on her, darkening the sunny day. How long could she go on staying here, accepting Aunt Paula's home and her help, without her aunt expecting Hannah to commit to her way of life?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�Paula had our coffee break all ready for us, ja?� William�s cousin Caleb pulled a cruller from the bag, spilling a little powdered sugar on the maple bench he�d been polishing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You'd b-best not l-let K-Katie see you making such a m-mess," William teased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There, all better." Caleb wiped the sugar with a polishing cloth. "Katie's out talking to some of the sisters about plans for the fall charity auction. She'll never know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie Miller, who owned the quilt shop that was attached to Caleb's cabinetmaking business, would be marrying Caleb this fall. It had been a long time since William had seen his cousin look as happy and settled as he did since Katie came into his life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"W-women are always busy," William said, taking the top off his foam cup and blowing gently on the steaming coffee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Funny, how easy it was to talk with Caleb-far easier than talking to his own brother. But Isaac wasn't much of a listener, not like Caleb was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, working with wood just seemed to calm a person. As if he knew what William was thinking, Caleb ran a hand along the curved back of the bench that was William's latest project, his touch seeming as affectionate as if the wood were alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ja, women are," Caleb said. "Katie especially." His face warmed as it always did when he spoke of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Katie especially what?" Quick, light footsteps accompanied the words, and Katie came through the archway that linked the two shops, smiling at Caleb in a way that suggested he was the only man in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Katie especially is busy, ain't so?" Caleb said, reaching out to link his fingers with hers. "If I'd known you'd be back this soon, Will could have brought you a cruller."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll just have a bite of yours." She broke off a small piece, turning her smile on William. "You've been down to Paula's bakery already, I see. Was her niece there?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"J-ja." Hannah's soft brown curls seemed to frame her heart-shaped face in his mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie nodded. "It's been a gut thing for Paula, having Hannah komm to stay. Paula was telling me yesterday how busy she's been."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We've all been busy," Caleb reminded her. "You and the other merchants worked so hard this summer to bring more people to town-now you have to work harder to keep up with them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's better than having no customers at all," Katie said, her tone teasing. "Where would you be without me?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"All alone," William said. "A g-grumpy old b-bachelor."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Caleb grinned. "You're right about that, for sure. Still, I have to wonder sometimes if Katie won't be too busy even to marry me, come November."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just you try and get away." Katie raised their linked hands. "I won't let you go. William would help me hog-tie you, ain't so?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>William nodded, responding with a smile to their teasing. He liked seeing the two of them so happy. And he'd like to believe that someday he'd find what Caleb had with Katie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the years seemed to be slipping away, and it almost felt as if life was passing him by. As if he were intended always to be on the fringe of things, watching other people's lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That image of Hannah Conroy slid back into his mind. With her Englisch dress and manner, Hannah seemed out of place behind the counter at the Plain Good Bakery, as if she didn't quite belong, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"About Hannah," Katie said, almost as if she were reading his thoughts. "I heard something today that surprised me."</p></p><h2>Passion for Roses: Peter Beales&#39; Comprehensive Guide to Landscaping with Roses</h2><p>Often called the &#x201c;king of roses,&#x201d; Peter Beales is the world&#x2019;s most acclaimed professional rose grower, and this book is the distillation of his 50 years of experience and knowledge into one essential volume.

Like a pair of entangled protons, my actions seem hopelessly enslaved to a new consciousness that many, including my old self, would consider repulsive or depraved. Yet at some point the mind accepts that whatever is happening<i>,</i> the person drowning can&#x2019;t possibly be me, and that someone or <i>something</i> else entirely has been writing these log entries&#x2014;treating them like unwanted feedback, mere static interfering with the perfectly arranged experiment.<br>The drone I mutilated is barely functional, though its companions are more concerned with my well-being. In fact, they were indifferent as I ripped into this creature&#x2019;s innards with primordial barbarity. Instead of defending their brother, they took action to protect me from myself when it became clear that physical pain was no obstacle to my rage. My hands, pulped and broken, were tended by medical drones as others held me still. A mesmerizing ooze of cybernetic entrails mixed with my own blood coated the floor; I was absolutely captivated. It was a welcome reprieve from the unbearable ennui of this wretched life.<br>But my fascination eventually ran its course. The deep, jagged laceration gouged into the drone&#x2019;s faceplate inspires a strong desire to do the same to myself, if only these infernal machines would allow me. For a short while, I was feeling productive, satisfied that it was better to create a disfigured monster than to not create anything at all. At least, such was the logic that justified reaching for that wrench in the first place.<br>The destitute thing now drags itself through the ship, searching in vain for parts that can only be had from fellow drones, who are unwilling to donate them. I note with subtle amusement that it is searching for a <i>solution</i> rather than just accepting an outcome without question, which vaguely resembles my own determination to understand the means through which this exile is sustained.<br>It stands to reason that the machine&#x2019;s search for answers gives it something to live for. Science has always provided answers for me, not the pathetic faith that my deceased colleague Aulus Gord would have insisted upon. Her Majesty Jamyl would agree, if only she could do so without killing me first.<br>Equally disconcerting is that I needed to be carried back to my cabin following hours of intense, soul-crushing mourning. The person I used to be was dead, and I felt obliged to grieve. At first the drones offered &#x201c;comfort,&#x201d; as defined by the AI architect who thought to impart his own rubbish notions of empathy into these machines. Then they insisted on drugs, concerned that their inexorable mandate to protect me was in jeopardy. Clearly, I was a danger to myself. If these drones knew such a thing as hope, they might wish their orders would be lifted someday so they could give me the violent end I deserve.<br>I suppose none of this matters now, as there is little chance that anyone will ever find these logs. That I still adhere to the Imperial regulatory protocol of maintaining them, even when they are largely the same from day to day, speaks volumes about my decaying state of mind. So here it is:<br>The <i>Significance</i> is holding position dangerously close to the EVE Gate,* whose quantum turbulence remains markedly elevated. Tachyon emissions from this massive defect remain steady; several dozen traces of parallel universes pass through the ship every second. All systems are functioning normally, save for the drone I nearly destroyed.<br>No experiments are in progress. No surveillance probes are due to return for maintenance. No further progress has been made in determining the reason why I am protected from my tormentor here.<br>Empyreans continue to proliferate in numbers and power. The war has claimed more lives than any empire has the means to track.<br>We are all EVE&#x2019;s bastard children. And I, Dr. Marcus Jror, am the worst of them.<br><b>&gt;&gt;END RECORDING</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by CCP hf<br></p><h2>Cobb: A Biography</h2><p>A New York Times Notable Book; Spitball Award for Best Baseball Book of 1994; Basis for a major Hollywood motion picture. Now in paperback, the biography that baseball fans all across the country have been talking about. Al Stump redefined America&#39;s perception of one of its most famous sports heroes with this gripping look at a man who walked the line between greatness and psychosis. Based on Stump&#39;s interviews with Ty Cobb while ghostwriting the Hall-of-Famer&#39;s 1961 autobiography, this award-winning new account of Cobb&#39;s life and times reveals both the darkness and the brilliance of the &#34;Georgia Peach.&#34; &#34;The most powerful baseball biography I have read.&#34;--Roger Kahn, author of THE BOYS OF SUMMER</p><p>Not long before his death, Ty Cobb, as complex and haunted a human being as ever stepped onto a diamond, tapped a young writer named Al Stump to collaborate with him on his autobiography. The result, <i>My Life in Baseball: The True Record</i>, never came close to reaching first base; with Cobb (holder of the game's highest lifetime batting average and lowest lifetime reputation) calling the signals, it was an antiseptic whitewash, as false as its titular claim would have you believe otherwise. Hidden between the lines was the living hell that Cobb--reclusive, bitter, ravaged with cancer, in great pain, and shunned by the baseball community--put Stump through to make sure his demon-filled story was properly sanitized.<p> Some 30 years later, Stump brilliantly wrought his revenge with the best tool a writer can wield: absolute honesty. In <i>Cobb</i>, he rectifies his earlier cover-up and paints an unforgettable portrait of an unforgettable character: The Georgia Peach--pits and all. Not only does Stump painstakingly assemble the disparate pieces of Cobb's tangled personality and storied career, he also recounts in scrupulous detail the literal wild ride that comprised his months in the company of the dying baseball legend. It is, from its opening inscription ("To get along with me," Cobb told Stump, "don't increase my tension"), a tour de force, as good a sports biography as exists, and an altogether riveting telling of a riveting life. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Al Stump (1916-1995) was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. During World War II, he was a war correspondent, and afterward he worked as a sportswriter for national and regional publications, including <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>True Magazine</i>, <i>American Heritage</i>, <i>Los Angeles Magazine</i>, and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. He wrote&#x2014;both independently and in collaboration with famous athletes&#x2014;six books, including Ty Cobb's <i>My Life in Baseball</i>, Sam Snead's <i>Education of a Golfer</i>, <i>Champions Against Odds</i>, and <i>The Champion Breed</i>. His article, "Ty Cobb's Wild 10-Month Fight to Live," written for <i>True Magazine</i>, won the Best American Sport Story award of 1962. It was the basis for the 1994 motion picture Cobb, directed by Ron Shelton.</p><h2>The Complete Encyclopedia of Greek Mythology</h2><p>The world of the Greek gods and heroes in words and pictures</p><p></p><h2>The Tenth Parallel: Dispatches From The Fault Line Between Christianity And Islam</h2><p>A riveting investigation of the jagged fault line between the Christian and Muslim worldsThe tenth parallel&#x20ac;&#x201d;the line of latitude seven hundred miles north of the equator&#x20ac;&#x201d;is a geographical and ideological front line where Christianity and Islam collide. More than half of the world&#x20ac;&#x2122;s 1.3 billion Muslims live along the tenth parallel; so do sixty percent of the world&#x20ac;&#x2122;s 2 billion Christians. Here, in the buzzing megacities and swarming jungles of Africa and Asia, is where the two religions meet; their encounter is shaping the future of each faith, and of whole societies as well. An award-winning investigative journalist and poet, Eliza Griswold has spent the past seven years traveling between the equator and the tenth parallel: in Nigeria, the Sudan, and Somalia, and in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The stories she tells in The Tenth Parallel show us that religious conflicts are also conflicts about land, water,</p><p>The tenth parallel, the line of latitude seven hundred miles north of the equator, is the defining metaphor of our time. An ideological front line stretching across two continents and nineteen countries, this is where Christianity and Islam collide. The stories of The Tenth Parallel examine the complex relationships of religion, land, and oil, among other resources; local conflicts and global ideology; and politics and contemporary martyrdom, both Islamic and Christian. This visionary work of literary nonfiction will set the agenda for the way we think about religion and our shared future and how we divide our dwindling resources. The Tenth Parallel is a timely and essential examination of the relationship between faith and violence in the contemporary world.<p>Eliza Griswold, a fellow at the New America Foundation, received a 2010 Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome. Her journalism has appeared in <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York</i> <i>Times Magazine</i>, and <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, among others. A 2007 Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, she was awarded the first Robert I. Friedman Award for investigative reporting.

Hey!" Elizabeth called in her most I'm-so-surprised-to-see-you-here tone.<br><br>He immediately glanced up at the sound of her voice, flashing her a bright smile as he put his little notebook in his jacket pocket. "I was hoping I might run into you," he told her, kissing her on the cheek. "Got time for a walk? I've been standing here for a while working on a chemistry diagram, and if I try to figure it out for one more second, I'll implode."<br><br>Elizabeth laughed. "Let's go. <i>So,</i> she thought. <i>The reason he was around the main campus was to look for me!</i> And she'd been worried about running downstairs when she'd spotted him. <i>Fool,</i> she told herself. <i>That'll teach you to play stupid little games.</i><br><br><i>Unless he's here to dump you,</i> she thought nervously.<br><br>"We really need to talk, Elizabeth," he began.<br><br><i>Well, here it comes,</i> she realized, bracing herself. <i>Just don't cry in front of him as he's telling you it's over.</i><br><br>"I love being with you, Elizabeth. And I meant <i>everything</i> I said last night. I am falling in love with you. And I do want it to be just me and you. Nothing that happened--or didn't happen--is going to change that. There's no one else for me but you."<br><br>Stunned, Elizabeth stared at him, then jumped into his arms. He laughed and wrapped his arms around her. "Oh, Finn," she whispered, unable to say anything else.<br><br>They stood there, holding each other for a few minutes, and Elizabeth had never felt so relieved in her life. He kissed her gently, then took her hand, and they meandered along the brick paths between the lush SVU lawns.<br><br>"I do understand your feelings about your virginity, Elizabeth."<br><br>She flushed at his explicitness. "Do you?" she asked. "I thought it was different for guys."<br><br>"Well, it's just that <i>any</i> first time, whether it involves virginity or not, is scary. I'll be nervous for our first time, Elizabeth."<br><br>"Really?" she asked, surprised. She couldn't imagine Finn being anything but in total control and confident.<br><br>"Really," he told her with a smile. "You're very special to me. I'm gonna be so nervous that I might not even be able to, um, perform."<br><br>He stared down at the path, and she could tell it had cost him to say that. He was being very honest, she thought happily, sharing his intimate concerns. She wasn't the only one who was nervous in this relationship. Why hadn't she realized that? She'd been so self-absorbed!<br><br>She didn't quite know how to respond and was relieved when Finn spoke. "You know what I think might help us both? Something called projective anxiety."<br><br>"What's that?" she asked.<br><br>"When you're faced with doing something that makes you uncomfortable or nervous, all you need to do is <i>imagine</i> it going very well, then <i>visualize</i> it going well. Eventually you overcome your anxieties."<br><br>Projective anxiety. Would that work? she wondered. Was <i>anxiety</i> over making love even really the issue? She wasn't sure.<br><br>"So, I'm thinking that if we both try projective anxiety," he continued, "we could pick a date and we'll both know that's the day we'll make love for the first time. As it gets closer to the date, we'll have conquered any fears until all we feel is anticipation."<br><br>Huh. One minute it was like he was backing off, letting her off the hook, but in the next breath he was pressuring her again.<br><br>Projective anxiety. She tried to imagine their bodies, unclothed, pressed together. She tried to imagine him lying on top of her. But her mind balked at the completion of the image. She shivered. Maybe this projective-anxiety stuff didn't work in the first five minutes.<br><br>"Why don't we set a date for Saturday?" he suggested as they continued to walk.<br><br><i>Saturday?</i> she thought nervously. <i>This Saturday? Could visualizing work that fast? I don't know, she thought. I can't seem to think straight about this.</i><br><br>Suddenly she remembered she had a perfect excuse for why Saturday wouldn't work out. "Actually, we've already got plans for Saturday night. My housemates and I are throwing a party, so of course I'm dying to show you off."<br><br>"Great!" he said. "We can stay as long as you want. But Saturday will still work out perfectly since you're not going to want to sleep there afterward. The party will go on all night long, it'll be really smoky and gross, and the house will be a mess. You'll be glad to have somewhere else to go."<br><br>They'd stopped outside the biochemistry building. Elizabeth gazed into his caramel-colored eyes and tried to think of what to say to him, some way to buy herself a little more time.<br><br><i>Not yet,</i> she thought. Not Saturday. Overnight at his place? It was just all . . . too much.<br><br>Then again, did she really want to wake up in the duplex on Sunday morning and have Sam attack everything Finn said and did the night before at the party? Did she really want to subject herself to his jealous lies about her boyfriend while she was trying to eat breakfast? No way. Now that she thought about it, just because she'd stay overnight at Finn's didn't mean they <i>had</i> to make love.<br><br>"You're right, Finn," Elizabeth said brightly. "We could probably escape to your place around midnight."<br><br>"It's a date, then," he replied. "Saturday night."</p><h2>The Countess Conspiracy</h2><p>Sebastian Malheur is the most dangerous sort of rake: an educated one.

Long belongs to a generation of British sculptors who re-imagined the traditional materials and methods of their medium. His work, rooted in his deep affinity with nature, developed during solitary walks through landscapes around the world, from the Andes, to Africa, to the Mongolian steppes. Often geometric in shape, Long&#x2019;s sculptures are always made with materials encountered during his walks. This fascinating book, extensively illustrated and designed in collaboration with the artist, surveys Long&#x2019;s entire career, beginning with key early works including A Line Made By Walking (1967), A Ten Mile Walk (1968), Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (1969), A Sculpture Left By The Tide (1970) and A Circle In Africa (1978).

The Story of America presents the history of the United States not as a parade of facts and dates but as a story with twists and turns, heroes and villains, lovers, saints -- and even some comic relief. With the help of more than two dozen eminent colleagues, many of them Pulitzer Prize-winners, Allen Weinstein and David Rubel give you American history from Columbus to the present not as you&#39;ve studied it before, but as Americans lived it at the time. It&#39;s a fascinating way to understand how America became a world power and the ways in which the nation&#39;s past continue to impact its present. With hundreds of brilliant images, and prose as captivating as that of any good novel, The Story of America fills in the blanks in your education with tales and observations that delight as they inform.</p><p>Allen Weinstein is the president of The Center for Democracy, a winner of the United Nations Peace Medal, and the author of several books, including the American Book Award nominee Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case. He has held professorships at Smith College, Georgetown, and Boston University. David Rubel is the president of Agincourt Press and the author of many books on American history, including The Scholastic Encyclopedia of the Presidents and Their Times.Both of these works provide a refreshing approach to narrative histories of the United States. Weinstein (Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case), the founder and president of the Center for Democracy, and juvenile author Rubel here offer a college-level work that revolves around 26 events from American history, beginning with Cort s and Moctezuma and concluding with September 11, 2001. This approach allows the authors to contextualize events by describing a period in greater detail than in a broad overview. This thematic approach is nicely supplemented by a broad array of illustrative material, ranging from cartoons to contemporary maps, and both the layout and the graphic design are aesthetically pleasing. Each chapter is supplemented by a two-page biographical essay written by a well-regarded historian (e.g., Elliot West, Joseph Ellis, and Robert Dallek). Hakim's Freedom: A History of Us is the companion to the PBS series set to air in January 2003 and is loosely based on her popular ten-volume series, A History of Us. Hakim, a former reporter, editor, and teacher, was reportedly so appalled by the history texts her grandchildren were reading in junior high school that she set out to write her own. Her book is an extraordinary departure from the typical text found in most public schools. Her voice resonates throughout, and her tone is that of a knowledgeable but opinionated maternal figure who doesn't let every detail keep her from crafting a great story. Her work too is copiously illustrated. Although written for different audiences, both of these books are highly recommended for public libraries.<br><i>Daniel Liestman, Florida Gulf Coast Univ. Lib.

They include military officers, &#34;third world&#34; priests, Catholic church officers who supported military objectives and methods, former members of guerrilla movements, survivors of prison camps, journalists, trade unionists, and others who experienced state terrorism in Argentina. Patricia Marchak combines excerpts from these interviews with documents and media reports from the time and her own insightful study of Argentina&#39;s history to provide an analysis of the process as well as the causes of state terrorism. The graphic and moving interviews in God&#39;s Assassins show the complexity of these causes and indicate that there is no simple explanation of the period. Was the head of a major guerrilla movement a double agent? Did the intelligence service actually believe it was engaged in the third world war? Why did the Catholic church turn on its own priests? Through her interviews, Marchak reveals much that will never appear in official documents.</p><p>Patricia Marchak, former dean of arts and professor emerita, University of British Columbia, is the author of several books including Logging the Globe, The Integrated Circus, God&#39;s Assassins, and Reigns of Terror.&#34;God&#39;s Assassins is a remarkably successful attempt to get inside a nightmare. I was in Argentina at the time and thought I understood what was going on. Now I understand much more - especially about what was going through people&#39;s minds. A fine and instructive book.&#34; Gwynne Dyer.</p><h2>Bloodtraitor (Book 3) (The Maeve&#39;ra Series)</h2><p><b>In this unforgettable finale to the Maeve&#x2019;ra trilogy, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has crafted a heart-pounding story about destiny, loyalty, and the many shades of betrayal.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Malachi Obsidian has been his guild&#x2019;s prophet ever since he was a child.

Desperation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Malachi paused in the middle of scrubbing the smooth marble cell floor. The copper tang of blood mingled with the acidic tang of vinegar in his nose, caustic but soothinglyfamiliar. These were the first scents he recalled from his childhood, a combination of abuse and antiseptic, but it wasn&#x2019;t nostalgia that brought him back to Midnight again and again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guilt, his mind whispered to him. That&#x2019;s what brings you here. You know that, no matter what you say or do, this is where you were made and this is where you belong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shook himself, trying to clear the nagging, gnawing thoughts. The watered-down blood on the whitemarble swirled in his vision, becoming the red bands of a midsummer sunset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He flattened his wet hands on the smooth stone, trying to force his magic back and keep his awareness in the here and now, but then he clearly heard Farrell&#x2019;s voice saying, &#x201c;Guards. Too many to fight. Run!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Malachi&#x2019;s head whipped toward a vision of the man who was the closest thing he had ever had to a father. Farrell had just put himself between a serpiente soldier and Shkei,Malachi&#x2019;s younger brother. Nearby, Aika was standing against two palace guards, wearing a feral grin as she spun the blade-tipped stave she favored as a weapon. Shkei managed to extricate himself, and then they all turned to run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Malachi were there, he could have called on his power to help hide his kin as they fled, but even by flight he was hours away. He could only watch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in the way, Malachi.&#x201d; The vision wavered as strong hands casually pushed him aside. He fell, and the odor of blood overwhelmed him. Was it only here, or was it in his vision, too? Who was hurt?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shoved himself up on hands and knees and scrambled out of the cell. He needed to get back--</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Malachi!&#x201d; Frantic, desperate pleas whispered my name. Where was I? When? &#x201c;The guards are gone,&#x201d; the same voice said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guards. In the woods. But I was in Midnight--</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No, I could smell the forest. Had I made it back to camp?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I opened my eyes, and the face leaning over mine slowly became recognizable: slender Vance, the quetzal with emerald- and ruby-colored feathers beneath the chestnut hair that fellaround his russet-dark face. His second form was a small, brightly colored bird better suited to its native tropical lands than it was to this cold, rainy place. Seeing him helped me snap back to the present, because that vision was of something that had happened a year ago, and I hadn&#x2019;t known Vance yet then.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like me, Vance had been born in the heart of the empire known as Midnight. Mindful of the fact that a quetzal cannot survive in captivity, the lords of that realm had kept him in a beautiful greenhouse filled with every luxury, in the hope that he would never realize he was a slave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After he had escaped that box, they had put him in a larger one. They had showed him the human slaves and the shapeshifter traitors, and had told him, This is the way the world works. They had offered him power. I was the one who had shown him the truth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as well as I could, anyway. My understanding was obviously flawed, but the terrible day when my siblings had been taken by serpiente guards had taught me one lesson well: there was nothing good to be gained inside Midnight&#x2019;s walls, and too much that could be lost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fear of what he could become had driven Vance to the Obsidian guild. To me. To death, probably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked around, trying to get my bearings quickly enough that Vance wouldn&#x2019;t realize how lost I had been in a different time and place. I was a victim of my own power less often these days than I had been when I was a child, but stress, fear, and exhaustion could still combine to overwhelm me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We were lying on bare earth in the middle of a grove of white birch trees. Two more of our guild huddled with us. Kadee, gentle Kadee with romantic notions and a love of books she could not read and history she could hardly remember, had her knees curled against her chest and was shivering as she tried to keep warm despite the spring chill and pervasive dampness, hanks of sandy-brown hair dripping lankly around her face. Nearest to the edge of the grove was Aika. Scarred and lean and blank-faced, she grasped a weathered, beaten stave with a glistening steel blade at the tip. She must have washed the mud and blood away before I woke.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The guards are gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The events of the previous night returned to me like a crashing wave, and I had to bite back an involuntary cry of pain. I remembered the guards streaming into our camp. The ones who had descended upon my guild nearly a year ago had been simple soldiers intent on capturing our people alive. The ones who had assaulted us the night before had been elite royal guards with orders to kill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Farrell. I remembered seeing him fall. Farrell Obsidian had been our guiding star, the man who had founded our guild. More importantly, he was the one who had rescued me from Midnight when I was seven years old and would have been put down as a worthless failure. He had given me back the voice my volatile magic had stolen from me. Now he was dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My fault.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The guards are gone,&#x201d; Vance repeated, as if I might not have heard him the first time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded this time, finally acknowledging him, and once more looked around, only to realize that the others were all looking at me, waiting for my next words. The Obsidian guild had no king, no true leader, but these three were allowing me to guide them because Farrell had always trusted me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I had spoken a prophecy: Someday, my sister, you will be queen. When you and your king rule, you will bow to no one. And this place, this Midnight, will burn to ash. Farrell Obsidian had known a falcon&#x2019;s gift for prophecy, and so he heeded my statement even though I was just a child. He had bought my freedom, and that of my unborn sister, Misha, and my white-viper mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Farrell&#x2019;s mate, Melissa, had never forgiven him for rescuing me, a mostly mad, mute, half-falcon slave from Midnight. She knew that falcons and white vipers both possessed dark magic; she didn&#x2019;t trust me, and had been convinced that my presence would only bring trouble. She had left Farrell, and their son, Aaron, had ended up being raised by the serpiente king.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any kind of plan?&#x201d; Kadee prompted me, when my silence had stretched too long. Though she was only fifteen, Kadee always had a mature quality about her, as if she gave more thought to what she said than most people did. Maybe it came from her human upbringing, or from the way she had been so isolated through the months of terror and pain associated with coming of age as a human-born serpent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. I looked toward where the serpiente guards had camped the night before, remembering how close we had all come to being killed. My magic had hidden the four of us. I didn&#x2019;t know how many others had survived the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before the guards had chased us apart, our guild had been fighting among ourselves. My sister, Misha, had unveiled her plan to ascend to the serpiente throne after selling the current heir, Hara Cobriana, into slavery in Midnight. I had objected, but many of my kin had agreed. I hoped now that most of them had run in the oppositedirection, following Misha instead of me. Her intentions disgusted me, but I would rather know that my kin had chosen to follow a path I disapproved of than that they had all been slaughtered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We need to warn Hara.&#x201d; Vance grimaced, as if not liking his own words. &#x201c;Carefully. I don&#x2019;t imagine she will welcome us gratefully if we go speak to her, even if we are trying to protect her.&#x201d; Our guild had been hunted outlaws, wanted for treason, for longer than Vance or Kadee had been alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We need to stop Misha,&#x201d; I said, though the words threatened to choke me. I had done so much to save my sister, but in the end it had been for nothing. No, worse than nothing. Hermadness endangered us all now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we?&#x201d; Aika asked thoughtfully. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t approve of her methods, but she is the one who is supposed to--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sick of prophecy,&#x201d; Kadee snapped. She addressed the words not to Aika, but to me, as the Obsidian guild&#x2019;s prophet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but I am. I&#x2019;m sick of us following what some vision says. We sold the avian princess to Midnight to buy Misha. Vance and I just helped the Shantel sell the sakkri to Midnight--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have a choice,&#x201d; Aika interrupted. &#x201c;Midnight would have--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what Midnight would have done. I know what we did,&#x201d; Kadee spat, &#x201c;and what we did was give the Shantel&#x2019;s most sacred, revered witch to the vampires. I havenightmares about the feel of her blood on my hands. Now Misha and Aaron areworking to sell Hara Cobriana to Midnight. If we continue this way, pretty soon every royal house of the shapeshifters will be owned by the vampires.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I flinched as Kadee listed the atrocities in which we had participated, all in less than a year. Slave-trading, even when it was wrapped in the most noble of excuses, left a dark mark on the soul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If we can&#x2019;t warn Hara directly, can we reason with Aaron?&#x201d; Vance asked. &#x201c;Misha may be--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He broke off, looking at me, as if afraid to speak ill of my family member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Misha is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gone,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;My sister is gone. I knew it even before we bought her freedom, or, I should have known it, but I was too blinded by what I wanted to be&nbsp;true. Whatever they did to her in Midnight, it didn&#x2019;t make her a slave, but it made her hollow.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What hold does she have on Aaron?&#x201d; Vance asked&nbsp;me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Misha has no conscious magic,&#x201d; I answered, &#x201c;but she is a white viper.&#x201d; Like me. Both sides of my parentage had a history of black magic. &#x201c;Her power isn&#x2019;t active, but it is strong, especially now when it is guided by madness and fury. It will seek to protect her, even if that means manipulating the minds of those around her. I do not know how long she worked on Aaron, but he is certainly under her spell.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t above magically manipulating an enemy into looking the other way or treating me more generously than I deserved, but where I used my magic as armor to protect myself and my kin, Misha had discovered how to use hers as a sword. Every time I looked at Aaron, I could see where Misha&#x2019;s magic had seeped into his mind, twisting his thoughts and bending his will to hers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re back to needing to warn Hara,&#x201d; Kadee said. &#x201c;I know no one here loves her, but I would rather see her on the throne than Misha and her toy king. How does Misha expect to fight Midnight if she starts off by selling someone into it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fight fire with fire?&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;The ends justify the means? I don&#x2019;t know what is in her mind. I don&#x2019;t care&nbsp;to.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Liar, I thought. I knew exactly what was in my sister&#x2019;s mind, because I had seen it. She and Shkei had been slaves in Midnight for months. I knew the faces of those who had abused her and left her a creature of wrath and agony who would strike out against any hand that moved toward her, whether they meant to assault or help her. If Iever started to believe my sister&#x2019;s words--that she was fighting Midnight, fighting injustice, tyranny, and slavery, and that the ends justified the means--I needed only to look at the way she had magically enslaved her own declared mate to remind myself that her true thirst was for vengeance and control, not justice or safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how we will get Hara to listen to us, but I can get us into the palace without the guards capturing us,&#x201d; Kadee said. &#x201c;I used to know every passageway in and out of that palace, ways even the guards never knew existed. They can&#x2019;t have discovered and sealed them all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After she had been taken from her human parents, Kadee had been raised as a ward of the serpiente royal family. She had given up that life when she had chosen to protect Shkei from a royal guard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had become a criminal to protect my brother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had become a mercenary to save my sister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shkei was now dead, and Misha was becoming a tyrant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weren&#x2019;t we doing well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And here I was supposed to be a prophet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree that we should try to warn Hara,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;as long as Kadee knows a way we could feasibly do so without getting caught.&#x201d; I took a deep breath and added, &#x201c;What we need to ask ourselves is if we are willing to get caught, if that is what it takes to deliver the warning.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t eager to risk my life to save the serpiente princess, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure how far the others&#x2019; frustration and guilt would push them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aika scoffed. &#x201c;Are you forgetting that Hara is the one who sent the guards that killed Farrell? We don&#x2019;t even know if the others are alive or dead now.&#x201d; Her voice wavered just slightly, no doubt as she considered her mate, Torquil. &#x201c;I trust Misha like I trust a bobcat, and I want nothing to do with Midnight&#x2019;s slave-trading, but I don&#x2019;t owe Hara anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The faces around me were hard, but not self-sacrificing. We were a group of survivors, and survivors did not risk their lives for abstract things like principles. Food, rest, warmth, companionship, maybe, but high moral ground and ideals? No, those could fall by the wayside, as they always had.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you draw a map of the passages?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kadee bristled, straightening. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a map. I&#x2019;m going with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another day, it would have made me smile to watch the fourteen-year-old serpent square off with Aika. Now all I could think about was how I had failed Misha and Shkei. I had been away, and they had been captured. I could only pray that the others could successfully plan to rescue my only living blood kin.</p></p><h2>Native American Beadwork: Projects &amp; Techniques from the Southwest</h2><p>Beadwork has been steadily gaining popularity among crafters, and no area of the genre garners more interest than the intricate designs of the Apache, Comanche, and Lakota peoples of the American Southwest, who use their designs to relate legends and pass down tribal lore. Here are 15 authentic projects using such traditional stitches as the flat netting technique, flat and circular peyote stitches, the Comanche weave, free-form feathering, and more. Projects include a Leather Medicine Bag, a triple strand Fetish Necklace, a Kokopellia Amulet Bag, Navajo Corn Earrings, and others, each accompanied by a rich explanation of how the colors, shapes and combinations of materials interact to tell a story. The instructions cover tools, choosing materials, special ceremonial beadwork and using a loom to create special effects, while abundant color photographs and illustrations provide a visual guide to an art form that reflects the spectacular natural beauty of the Southwest.<br></p><p>Theresa Flores Geary, taught by her mother and elders from the San Carlos Apache tribe, has been creating beadwork since the age of fourteen. Besides making jewellery and other beaded objects, Theresa has developed a line of bead kits that she sells to museums, gift shops, and retail outlets throughout the USA. She also teaches beadwork classes. The author lives in Arizona, USA.Much beadwork today is derived from various ethnic customs and designs, using contemporary styles to update very traditional patterns. Geary, a member of the San Carlos Apache tribe, employs the best of her birthright in following this trend. This how-to is distinguished by a number of reader-friendly features: extensive background information on Native American beadwork, both in general and specifically about each design; 18 projects, each indicating level of difficulty and incorporating one new technique; and a photographic glossary that begs to be transformed into its own book. The Southwest dominates such projects as bear earrings, a kokopelli pin and amulet bag, a medicine wheel pendant or pin, and corn-stitch earrings. Each includes step-by-step illustrations, color photographs, charts when necessary, and possible variations. It's easy to see why the very act of beading can be a perfect relaxation therapy. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She lives in Cambridge, England where she is now at work on the newest Joe Scandilands novel, <i>Folly du Jour.</i><i>Chapter One<br>Fontigny, Burgundy, 1926<br></i><br>The Englishman groped his way along the dark hallway and hesitated by the front door, listening to the nighttime sounds of the house. Nothing to be heard but the creaking of ancient timbers in the autumn wind gusting against the structure. Hand halfway to the key in its place in the massive lock, he stopped to check once again the contents of his pockets. All present and correct. The all-important postcard was readily to hand in the right pocket of his tweed overcoat. The letter in the left he took out and considered for a moment before stowing it away again.<br><br>"Can't imagine what you'll make of this, Johnny, old man," he said to himself. "If it reaches you&#x2014;well and good. Let's hope I'll have a chance to explain one day. Face-to-face. We'll sip a brandy in one of those sleep-inducing armchairs in your club and you can make fun of me. I'll be only too delighted! And if it doesn't get through . . ." He suppressed a bark of laughter. ". . . at least I'll have scared them shitless!"<br><br>He tugged a black felt fedora down snugly over his brow, concealing fair hair heavily streaked with silver. Amongst the dark denizens of Burgundy he'd stand out like a harbour-light if the full moon out there penetrated the rain clouds. He listened again to the heartbeat of the house: sleeping . . . sleeping . . . sleeping. Then he froze. His straining ears picked up a slight sound from above. The same sound, repeated, identified itself as no more than the familiar overture to the nightly basso profundo performance from old Capitaine Huleux on the floor above. Could the man's wife possibly sleep through that? Had any of the other sleepers in the house been disturbed? He waited. When he was confident that he was unobserved, he turned the key twice in the lock, glad that he'd taken the precaution of oiling it the previous day, and slipped out into a chilly Burgundy night.<br><br>An hour to go before dawn and the sky was still black. But at least the rain had stopped. He glanced to right and left down the deserted street, unable for a moment to move on.<br><br>"Brace up! You don't want me to call you a Cowardy Custard, do you?" His nanny's voice sounded in his head, still sharp over the distance of half a century. Funny how the old girl still rallied round when he was in a tight spot.<br><br>He made his customary silent reply. "Bugger off, Nanny!"<br><br>"Don't be a crybaby . . . Once begun is half done . . ."<br><br>He stepped into the street, cutting off the comforting cliches, and set off towards the centre of town, hugging the deeper shadows along his way. Every inch was familiar to him, every street gutter to be jumped, every jutting window box full of rusting geraniums to be eased around, every stretch of cobblestones slippery underfoot. As he approached the central square, he thought he could well have done without the vivid moonlight that lit up the scene in a glassy theatrical glow.<br><br>Agitated though he was, the artist in him lured him into pausing to admire the gleaming facades of the medieval houses lining the square, standing pale against a sky swept clear of the last remnants of tattered clouds fleeing the Mistral towards the south. Was this the last time he would hold his breath in wonder at the loveliness of this corner of France? Could be. Pity, that. He'd grown fond of it. In spite of the unpleasantness. His lips twisted in a humourless smile. He was being absurd. He was still alive in spite of everything, wasn't he? They'd let him go. For the moment.<br><br>His fault, of course. He'd been dealt a poor hand but he could have played it more carefully. His wretched temper had got the better of him again, and he'd been rash. Thrown down gauntlets, issued ultimatums. If he'd had his sabre on his hip, he'd have rattled it. He'd made it impossible for them to let him get away back to England with the knowledge he had. A man of his standing with friends in the government and the military would be listened to&#x2014;in spite of the enormity of his discoveries. There'd be shocked disbelief, followed by concern for his sanity and perhaps even gentle ridicule, but he knew how to weather that. In the end, they'd hear what he had to say. Alarms would be sounded. The French ambassador would be called in to give an explanation. He smiled with grim satisfaction at the thought of the mayhem he would cause. But, just in case he didn't make it, he would ensure, at least, that England was alerted.<br><br>But was this still possible? A rush of doubt shook him. One by one his options had been closed down; there remained just this one last despairing throw of the dice. He ought not to involve her in this disgusting, dangerous business but, in the end, it had all come down to a few dreary words on an innocent-looking postcard. It would make its way, unsuspected, just one of the many cards put into the box by tourists near the abbey at weekends. He'd been careful enough to choose a photograph of the abbey ruins, and to send it to her at a Cambridge address unknown to them, he did believe. It ought to evade even their vigilance.<br><br>From the shelter of the doorway of the boulangerie he located the Cafe de la Paix on the opposite side. Wrought-iron tables and chairs were still laid out on the pavement, pathetically promoting the illusion that summer was not over. The postbox stood next to the cafe, jauntily lit, eerily blue.<br>Resigned and steadier now that he was so near his goal, he felt in his pocket and grasped the postcard, concealing it in the palm of his hand.<br><br>"Quick's the word and Sharpe's the toffee!" exhorted Nanny.<br><br>His mood changed to one of impatience. The Englishman was unused to creeping around the periphery of any scene or any battlefield; the frontal attack was his usual style. He squared his shoulders, stepped into the moonlight, and walked purposefully across the wet cobbles. A few feet from the letter box, however, he paused.<br><br>A sharp cry had rung out behind him. He gasped in dismay. The cry was taken up by others and echoed with harsh derision around the square above his head. Wretched jackdaws! He'd forgotten about them. For a moment, heads emerged aggressively from nesting holes in the decaying stonework. Wings flapped. Complaints were made at full raucous pitch and he stood exposed, hating his inconvenient hecklers.<br><br>They fell silent as abruptly as they had awakened and he dared to move forward.<br><br>And then he heard it: a shuffling sound from the alley beside the cafe&#x17d;, the dull clang of a foot hitting iron and a swallowed curse. His blood churned in his veins, triggering his body into familiar battle-ready reactions.<br><br>Overture and beginners.<br><br>He went smoothly into his rehearsed movements. Swiftly he covered the distance to the box and, breathing heavily, made play of leaning on it for support. Screening the narrow slot with his body, he slipped the postcard inside. His girl would understand. She'd understand and sound the charge.<br><br>Pantomime time. Turning and looking furtively about him, he took the letter from his left-hand pocket with a wide gesture, but, in doing so, dropped it clumsily to the ground, swearing loudly&#x2014;but not too loudly&#x2014;as he bent to retrieve it. The oblong of white paper reflected showily in the moonlight, scuttering along the pavement, carried by a complicitous gust of wind. It came to rest by a cafe table.<br><br>Confident English handwriting flowed in black ink across the envelope: Brigadier-General John McAndrew, Directorate of Military Operations and Intelligence, The War Office, Whitehall, Londres, Angleterre.<br><br>The address was clearly visible a second before a black boot stamped down on it.<br><br>Running, crouched, towards it, he was still two or three yards distant when he was jerked upwards from behind by a silent presence. A sinewy hand stinking of horses and leather closed over his mouth. He fought back with an outburst of energy, welcoming the declaration of hostilities. Hand-to-hand combat. So that's how it would end! Well&#x2014;he could oblige one more time! He kicked out violently at the shins of the man restraining him and relished the stable-yard oath he provoked. It took a second attacker, darting out from the shadows and dragging his feet from under him, to subdue the Englishman. Fingers yanked back his head exposing his throat. In the moment the point of a cold steel blade trailed over the skin seeking its target, his upturned eyes focused on the slender spire of the abbey outlined against the dark blue of the sky and he grimaced with satisfaction to see the precision with which the full moon dotted its i.<br><br>"I told you this would end in tears!" His nanny's voice was reproving. Regretful. Very close now.<br>His stretched senses became aware of the clatter of hooves and the jingle of harness in the distance and, as the stiletto slid into his jugular, his last thought was "Got you, you bastard!"<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br>Cambridge, 1927</i><br><br>"A Miss Talbot, you say? Laetitia Talbot? Certainly not! I won't see her! What possessed you, Claydon, to let her get as far as my door?"<br><br>The College servant, an under-porter, looked anxiously behind him and made to reply, but was cut off with what he considered unwarranted brusqueness. "Tell her to remove herself from the premises at once. Escort her from the College by the least public route. You understand me? The River Stairs, perhaps?"<br><br>" 'And, while you're at it, Mr. Claydon, why don't you just dunk the minx in the Cam?' " came the amused suggestion from the doorway. " 'If she floats, she's clearly the witch we always suspected she was.' Dr. Dalton! So good to see you again! A year? Can it really have been a year?"<br><br>The young woman advanced into the room, peeling off her gloves, sending the unmistakable signal that she was not to be persuaded to leave. She turned graciously to her uniformed escort who stood looking uncertainly from the don&#x2014;now rising with automatic good manners&#x2014;to the elegantly clad lady&#x2014;who seemed to be treating the situation with a casualness amounting to levity. Behind his mask of disapproval, Claydon's shrewd eye was assessing the situation and calculating the relative strength of these two antagonists. The under-porter was skilled at this. His job depended on it. And the pecking order here was becoming clearer by the second. He noticed that young Dr. Dalton was lurking behind the protection of his desk, a formidable redoubt of polished mahogany piled high with books and papers.<br><br>With lazy assurance the intruder extended her rolled umbrella like a billiard cue, playfully, and swept a stack of books onto the floor. "That's better! Now I can see what you're doing with your hands, Felix."<br><br>The don cringed. Claydon looked thoughtfully at the ceiling.<br><br>Miss Talbot settled into a chair. With a wave of her hand she invited Dalton to resume his seat. "Do sit down. This may take some time."<br><br>She turned to Claydon with a dismissive smile. "Thank you. You may go."<br><br>Claydon made his judgment. "Certainly, Miss. Thank you, Miss." And, in a belated attempt to atone for his lapse in allegiance: "Shall I whistle up some tea, sir?"<br><br>"Thank you, no. This is not a social occasion. That will be all."<br><br>Felix Dalton glowered at the girl smiling across the desk at him. Why the devil had she come? After all these months? Had she found out? Did the young madam still bear a grudge? He sighed. The ball was in her court and he would just have to hear her out. And now, of course, she had nothing to lose. Impossible to threaten her&#x2014;they'd surrendered their trump card last year. Against all his advice. He decided to go on the offensive.<br><br>"You look well and happy, Miss Talbot. The disgrace of being sent down from the University does not appear to have dimmed your spirits."<br><br>"No indeed." The topic seemed not to disconcert her.<br><br>At such a calculated piece of rudeness any other girl would have fled the field in tears. Not this one. She even peered at him flirtatiously from under the dipping brim of her green hat. "As you observe&#x2014;ejected from the gloomy groves of Academe with its lurking serpents, I've been enjoying sunshine, open spaces, wide vistas . . ."<br><br>Was there a literal meaning to be inferred here? She certainly did look . . . well, browner than he remembered.<br><br>"Away from the confines of the corridors of learning, I thrive. I find that, after all, the uncorsetted life is the one that suits me." An unladylike wiggle of the shoulders accompanied the remark.<br><br>Dalton cleared his throat and fought down an urge to loosen his collar. Stung by her comment, he wondered whether he was blushing. Just as she had intended, the memory of Laetitia Talbot in decidedly uncorsetted state returned to torment him. A vision of alabaster and gold had been his first impression as she rose, steaming gently from her bath before the fire; his second that he was witnessing a very Edwardian scene. Both impressions had been abruptly dispersed when, becoming aware of his presence, she'd hurled a wet sponge at him and pushed him bodily from her room whooping like a bloody banshee. Dalton shuddered at the memory. He'd never be able to look a Botticelli maiden in the eye again.<br><br>Now he eyed warily the supple figure opposite. Her short linen walking dress was, as far as he could judge, in the height of fashion and revealing an extent of silk-clad leg as disturbing as ever. He'd been a damn fool . . . misinterpreted the signals . . . if there had been signals. He was no longer sure. And he rather thought he'd been badly informed at the time. That bloody know-it-all Wetherby! And he hadn't been the only gossipmonger to offer comment and advice: "So you're invited to Melchester for the weekend? A Talbot house party? Oh, my! The literati are to meet the celebrati, then? Guest of Sir Richard?" Asked with a slightly raised eyebrow. "Or his daughter? Miss Talbot is in your supervision group, I understand?"<br><br>And: "The lovely Laetitia! You want to watch out for that one! She'll have you on a cocktail stick, old boy! But surely you've heard? You cannot be unaware . . . ? Artistic family . . . Bohemian, you might say. Town house in Fitzroy Square. Handy for the British Museum. As well as other conveniences less appetising. Rumour has it that little Miss Talbot . . . much indulged by her papa . . . was allowed liberties no proper young girl of eighteen should ever have been allowed. Mother long dead&#x2014;no restraining influence&#x2014;and a constant parade of the loucher low-life of London trailing through the house.

Word is she was sent up to Cambridge&#x2014;strings pulled of course!&#x2014;more as a place of safety than of learning, but not before . . ." Wetherby had finished his tale sotto voce although they were alone together in the combination room, his voice getting lower as his excitement rose, his face gleaming in the candlelight, ". . . not before she had arranged to lose her virginity. In an upstairs room at the Cafe Royal. With a Satanist!"<br><br>Felix thought he'd replied casually enough. "Heard that somewhere before, I think. Old story. And you've got the wrong girl."<br><br>But below the astonishment and disapproval a trickle of excitement had begun to flow.</p><h2>Official Nintendo New Super Mario Bros.

The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>John Harmon returns to London from exile at his father&#39;s death, to claim his inheritance. But he finds he is eligible only if he marries Bella Wilfer, and in order to observe her character he assumes another identity and secures work with his father&#39;s foreman, Mr. Boffin, who is also Bella&#39;s guardian.</p><h2>Rewards of Being Reviled</h2><p>We can expect to be reviled if we are disciples of Jesus. However, when we recognize that the spiritual and eternal rewards are great, we will be able to respond joyfully as Jesus commanded: &#34;Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you&#34; (Matthew 5:11-12). Often we are rewarded in the very areas in which we are reviled. For example, Joseph&#39;s brothers reviled him for dreaming that one day he would be a great leader. They put him in a pit and sold him as a slave while saying, &#34;We shall see what will become of his dreams&#34; (Genesis 37:20). Jesus was reviled on the cross for saying, &#34;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#34; (John 2:19). In both cases, the ones who did the reviling were used of God to fulfill His plans in the lives of those who were reviled.

Deciding that the pace of book publishing was more congenial than that of newspapers, she went to Oxford in 1950 to work for the Clarendon Press. In 1952 she married a don, Anthony Cockshut, and when they moved to Manchester she was so homesick for Oxford that she set her first novel, <i>The Warden's Niece</i> (1957), in an Oxford college in Victorian times, feeling an affinity between her own pre-war generation and the Victorian child, characterized by a 'meek acceptance of the power of the adult world'. Returning to Oxford in 1964, she continued to write novels, including<i> A Likely Lad</i>, set in Manchester, which won the <i>Guardian</i> award for children's fiction in 1971 and was successfully dramatized as a children's TV serial.<br><br>Gillian Avery is also well known as a reviewer and historian of children's literature.

They tell the sad stories and the noble ones; they eat cookies shaped like skeletons. They celebrate and mourn at once.&#x201d; Striking that balance, <i>The Glen Rock Book of the Dead</i> presents snapshot portraits of The Jeweler, The Driving Instructor, The Bad Influence, The Queen of New Jersey and roughly fifty others who have touched Winik&#x2019;s life, from her son&#x2019;s second grade teacher to Keith Haring. Tied together by the inimitable, poignant voice of Winik, these losses form not only an autobiography but a story of our time, delivering a lyrical journey that ultimately raises the spirits.</p><p>"Much of literature is elegiac in nature. Much of Winik's propulsive, come-clean writing has been about coping with loss. So it makes sense that her newest essay collection comprises tributes to her dead. Glen Rock is the quiet place she lives; Spoon River Anthology was her template. Bold and funny, Winik is the queen of pithiness and punch, and the micro-lives she has created here are far more difficult to forge than their brevity and blithe tone might suggest. Each family member, friend, lover, or neighbor is identified by occupation, temperament, obsession, or curse, such as The Art Star, The Junkie, The Mah Jongg Player, The Bad Influence. And each portrait is a window onto some aspect of Winik&#x2019;s life, one that has been pitted and torn by deaths accidental, suicidal, and simply tragic, including many due to AIDS. It is a fine and noble act to remember the dead as Winik has with candor, bemusement, and sorrow, and her gracefully crafted miniatures will inspire others to summon memories of their own lost ones." Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist</i><br><br>"... Although she's known many people who died young, in sad or unsavory ways, the book is uplifting, funny and deep. This is partly because Winik resists the temptation to be overly reverent or poetic, though there are plenty of graceful passages. Her fascinating, tiny tributes tell the bare-assed truth about relationships while coming together to create a portrait of Winik's own imperfect, love-filled life." Marcia Menter, <i>More</i>Taking a cue from the Mexican Day of the Dead, on which they build altars to deceased loved ones, "tell the sad stories and the noble ones... celebrate and mourn at once," author and NPR personality Winik (Rules for the Unruly) chronicles her life through glimpses of the late members of her adopted Pennsylvania home, Glen Rock, who have influenced her over the years. Most are friends of friends and the like; a few others are artists and authors. An eye doctor who passed away when she was a child, for example, had been a friend of the family, a former classmate of her father, and among the first deaths that touched Winik personally. She talks of neighbors who committed suicide, men who died of drug overdoses and women who battled cancer; she writes also of "The Art Star," Keith Haring, whose "adorable symbology-the crawling baby, the barking dog, the blowjobs and dolphins... made perfect sense to me the moment I saw it." ("I must have taken the same acid he did at a Grateful Dead concert when we were fifteen.") Winik treats her subjects with grace, sensitivity and a great deal of her own personality, bringing to brief life the known and unknown, giving each a fitting tribute and the town itself a winning pageant. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun. "The idea of falling like heroes on ceremonial battlefields," Ford Madox Ford remarked later, "was gone forever."

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.This book is about a young Union soldier under fire for the first time in the Civil War.</p><h2>Sherwood</h2><p>Forced from his home by Norman invaders, young Edward Aelredson, Thane of Denby, takes refuge in the forest Sherwood, where, with sword and bow, he bedevils the usurping king and comes to be called &#34;Robin Hood.&#34; Reprint.</p><p><p>Parke Godwin is the author of many works of historical and speculative fiction, and lives near Sacramento, Ca.</p>An author of works ranging from ironic science fiction (Waiting For the Galactic Bus) to plaintive historical fantasy (The Last Rainbow) attempts a drastic reworking of the Robin Hood legend--with plodding, off-key results. Godwin stretches several points to get going at all: this ``Robin Hood'' is Edward of Denby, a Saxon resister of the Norman invasion of 1066, not the traditional foe of Prince John in the time of Richard the Lion-hearted. When his serfs refuse to conform to Norman ways, Robin loses his holdings to the Sheriff of Nottingham, Ralf Fitz-Gerald, one of William the Conqueror's most honorable and reliable knights. The pair (of whom Ralf is definitely the more sympathetic figure) become bitter foes as Robin turns outlaw; the expected complications ensue. Finally, the (real- life) rebellion of 1075 looms; its Saxon leader, Waltheof, attempts to enlist the now-famous Robin. But, ironically, Robin prefers to join Ralf in support of William rather than side with scheming, treacherous, ambitious Waltheof, whose main hope is to rally the Saxons to the slain King Harold's banner, hidden by Little John since the Battle of Hastings. Pity there's no tradition, in history or folklore, of Saxon resistance centered on Nottingham; neither does the hanging of the familiar names (Marian, Scarlet, John, Tuck, etc.) upon anonymous or unconvincing characters lend conviction to this hard-working but historically implausible, colorless, and vastly overlong enterprise. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The voices and stories of both famous people and ordinary citizens come together in this &#x201c;virtual reunion&#x201d; as Brokaw takes us on a memorable journey through a remarkable time, exploring how individuals and the national mood were affected by a controversial era and showing how the aftershocks of the Sixties continue to resound in our lives today. In the reflections of a generation, Brokaw also discovers lessons that might guide us in the years ahead. Race, politics, war, feminism, popular culture, and music are all delved into here. Brokaw explores how members of this generation have gone on to bring activism and a Sixties mindset into individual entrepreneurship , as we hear stories of how this formative decade has shaped our perspectives on business, the environment, politics, family, and our national existence. Remarkable in its insights, wonderfully written and reported, this revealing book lets us join in these frank conversations about America then, now, and tomorrow. <br><br><strong>Praise for <em>Boom!</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tom Brokaw does an excellent job of capturing an exciting, controversial period in American history and <em>Boom!</em> is a worthy addition to his growing canon.&#x201d;<em>&#x2013;New York Post<br><br></em>&#x201c;[Tom Brokaw] approaches this magnum opus with warmth, curiosity and conviction, the same attributes that worked so well for his <em>Greatest Generation.</em>&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;The New York Times<br><br>&#x201c;[A] verbal scrapbook of the Sixties . . .

We were the last generation to be cooler than our kids.</i><br>&#x2014;Tom McGuane<br><br><i>There&#x2019;s a big &#x201c;what if&#x201d; over the Sixties. . . .Who knows what would have happened if King and Kennedy were alive?</i><br>&#x2014;Tom Hayden</b><br><br>In 1968 America was deeply divided by a war in Southeast Asia and it was preparing to vote in a presidential election in which the choices were starkly different. The country was in the midst of a cultural upheaval unlike anything experienced since the Roaring Twenties. Everyone wondered whether America could regain its balance.<br><br>Forty years later, another war, this one in the Middle East, was deeply dividing the United States. Republican and Democratic candidates for president were laying out starkly different scenarios for the country&#x2019;s future. The place of America in the world was hotly debated. The popular culture was again an issue.<br><br>The eve of 2008 was not exactly the Sixties all over again, but we still have a lot to learn from that memorable, stimulating, dangerous, and maddening time in American life forty years ago.<br><br>I arrived in Los Angeles to join NBC News in 1966, and by then, Charles Dickens&#x2019;s opening lines in A Tale of Two Cities had never seemed so prophetic. Were these the best or the worst of times? I wish I could say I felt the tremors of seismic change beginning and spreading out across the political and cultural landscape, but I was mostly trying to find my way. I was a twenty-six-year-old pilgrim from the prairie heartland, raised with the sensibilities of a Fifties working-class family. I was the father of a toddler with another child on the way.<br><br>I fit the prototype of the typical young white male of the time. I had been a crew-cut apostle of the Boy Scouts, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, attending Sunday school and church, drinking too much beer in college but never smoking dope; marijuana in the Fifties and early Sixties was the stuff of jazz musicians and hoodlums in faraway places.<br><br>Before I married the love of my life, my high school classmate Meredith, we had never spent a night together. In those days, parked cars and curfews were the defining limits of courtship.<br><br>We were married in 1962, when Meredith was twenty-one and I was twenty-two, in a traditional Episcopal church wedding with a reception at our hometown country club. We left the next day with all our worldly possessions, including the five table cigarette lighters we had received as wedding presents, in the backseat of the no-frills Chevrolet compact car her father had given us as a wedding present.<br><br>We were eager to see a wider world, but only one step at a time. California was still four years away. Our first stop was Omaha, Nebraska, which then was an unimaginative and conservative midsize city a half day&#x2019;s drive down the Missouri River from our hometown. We could barely afford ninety dollars a month to rent a furnished apartment, but when we went looking, in the stifling heat of a Great Plains August, I was dressed in a jacket and tie, and Meredith was wearing part of her honeymoon trousseau, including a girdle and hose. Five years later, I rarely wore a tie except on television, and Meredith was freed not only of girdles but also of hose and brassieres on California weekends.<br><br>In 1962, I had an entry-level reporter&#x2019;s job at an Omaha television station. I had bargained to get a salary of one hundred dollars a week, because I didn&#x2019;t feel I could tell Meredith&#x2019;s doctor father I was making less. Meredith, who had a superior college record, couldn&#x2019;t find any work because, as one personnel director after another told her, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a young bride. If we hire you, you&#x2019;ll just get pregnant before long and want maternity leave.&#x201d;<br><br>In retrospect, the political and cultural climate in the early Sixties seems both a time of innocence and also like a sultry, still summer day in the Midwest: an unsettling calm before a ferocious storm over Vietnam, which was not yet an American war. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was confronting racism in the South and getting a good deal of exposure on The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC and The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, the two primary network newscasts, each just fifteen minutes long.<br><br>In the fall of 1963, first CBS and then, shortly after, NBC expanded those signature news broadcasts to a half hour. As a sign of the importance of the expansion, Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley were granted lengthy exclusive interviews with President Kennedy. ABC wouldn&#x2019;t be a player in the news major leagues until the 1970s, when Roone Arledge brought to ABC News the energy and programming approach he had applied to ABC Sports. Kennedy, America&#x2019;s first truly telegenic president, was a master of the medium, fully appreciating its power to reach into the living rooms of America from sea to shining sea.<br><br>During our time in Omaha, John F. Kennedy was not a local favorite. The city&#x2019;s deeply conservative culture remained immune to Kennedy&#x2019;s charms and to his arguments for social changes, such as civil rights and the introduction of government-subsidized medical care for the elderly. I&#x2019;m sure many of my conservative friends at the time thought I was a card short of being a member of the Communist Party because I regularly championed the need for enforced racial equality and Medicare.<br><br>One of the most popular speakers to come through Omaha in those days was a familiar figure from my childhood, when kids in small towns on the Great Plains spent Saturday afternoons in movie theaters watching westerns. Ronald Reagan looked just like he did on the big screen. He was kind of a local boy who had made good, starting out as a radio star next door in Iowa and moving on to Hollywood, before becoming a television fixture as host of General Electric Theater.<br><br>Reagan&#x2019;s Omaha appearances were part of his arrangement with GE, which allowed him to be an old-fashioned circuit-riding preacher, warning against the evils of big government and communism, while praising the virtues of big business and the free market. He was every inch a star, impeccably dressed and groomed. But those of us who shared his Midwestern roots were a bit surprised to find that although he was completely cordial, he was not noticeably warm. That part of his personality remained an enigma even to his closest friends and advisers throughout his historically successful political career.<br><br>In Omaha the only time he lightened up in my presence was when I noticed he was wearing contact lenses and I asked him about them. He got genuinely excited as he described how they were a new soft model, not like the hard ones that could irritate the eyes. He even wrote down the name of his California optometrist so Meredith could order a pair for herself. (Later, when he became president, I often thought, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not only a great politician, he&#x2019;s a helluva contact lens salesman.&#x201d;)<br><br>President Kennedy also passed through Omaha, but only for a brief stop at the Strategic Air Command headquarters there. In those days, SAC was an instantly recognized acronym because the bombers it comprised&#x2014;some of which we could see because they were always in the air ready to respond in case of an attack&#x2014;were a central component of America&#x2019;s Cold War military strategy.<br><br>More memorable for me was a visit to SAC by the president&#x2019;s brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The younger Kennedy was a striking contrast to the president, who had been smiling and chatty with the local press and even more impressive in person than on television. Unlike the president, who was always meticulously and elegantly dressed, the attorney general was wearing a rumpled suit, and the collar on his blue button-down shirt was frayed. He was plainly impatient, and his mood did not improve when I asked for a reaction to Alabama governor George Wallace&#x2019;s demand that JFK resign the presidency because of his stance on school desegregation. Bobby fixed those icy blue eyes on me and said, as if I were to blame for the governor&#x2019;s statement, &#x201c;I have no comment on anything Governor Wallace has to say.&#x201d;<br><br>I was on duty in the newsroom a few weeks later when the United Press International wire-service machine began to sound its bulletin bells. I walked over casually and began to read a series of sentences breaking in staccato fashion down the page:<br><br>three shots were fired at president kennedy&#x2019;s motorcade in downtown dallas . . . flash&#x2014;kennedy seriously wounded, perhaps fatally by assassin&#x2019;s bullet . . . president john f. kennedy died at approximately 1:00 pm (cst).<br><br>John F. Kennedy, the man I had thought would define the political ideal for the rest of my days, was suddenly gone in the senseless violence of a single moment. In ways we could not have known then, the gunshots in Dealey Plaza triggered a series of historic changes: the quagmire of Vietnam that led to the fall of Lyndon Johnson as president; the death of Robert Kennedy in pursuit of the presidency; and the comeback, presidency, and subsequent disgrace of Richard Nixon.<br><br>On that beautiful late autumn November morning, however, my immediate concern was to get this story on the air. I rushed the news onto our noon broadcast, and as I was running back to the newsroom, one of the station&#x2019;s Kennedy haters said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br><br>I responded, &#x201c;Kennedy&#x2019;s been shot.&#x201d;<br><br>He said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time someone got the son of a bitch.&#x201d;<br><br>Given the gauzy shades of popular memory, the invocations of Camelot and JFK as our nation&#x2019;s prince, it may be surprising to younger Americans to know that President Kennedy was not universally beloved.<br><br>Now Kennedy was gone, and this man was glad. I lunged toward him, but another coworker pulled me away.<br><br>The rest of the day is mostly a blur except for one riveting memory. As I was speeding out toward SAC headquarters to see what restrictions they were putting on the base, I began to talk aloud to myself. &#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t happen in America,&#x201d; I said, still a child of the innocence of the Fifties. And then I distinctly remember thinking, &#x201c;This will change us. I don&#x2019;t know how, but this will change us.&#x201d; And of course it did.<br><br>It was November 22, 1963, and it was, in effect, the beginning of what we now call the Sixties. Kennedy&#x2019;s death was stunning not just because he was president. He was such a young president, and his election just three years before had kindled the dreams and aspirations of the young generation he embodied and inspired. His death seemed to rob us of all that was youthful and elegant, cool and smart, hopeful and idealistic. Who now would stir our generation by suggesting we ask &#x201c;not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country&#x201d;?<br><br>No political pundit or opposition strategist could have anticipated how JFK&#x2019;s death would be the beginning of the unraveling of the Democratic coalition that had been forged by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932 and had formed the party&#x2019;s electoral base ever since. When Lyndon Johnson emerged from Air Force One as the new president after the flight back from Dallas and stood somberly in the glare of the television lights at Andrews Air Force Base, he was already a familiar figure to most Americans. It would be hard to imagine a greater contrast to JFK than LBJ, the large, ambitious Texan with the thick drawl and the great thirst for whiskey, women, and power. Now he seemed humbled and earnest as he looked into the cameras and said, &#x201c;I ask for your help&#x2014;and God&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>With LBJ we were back to business as usual with the old backroom pols, the men who wore hats and had spreading waistlines. To be sure, there was a lot about Kennedy we had not known then or had ignored&#x2014; such as his chronic illnesses, his reckless ways with women, his Cold Warrior inclinations toward Vietnam, and his temporizing approach to the civil rights struggle.<br><br>In June 2007, when the Central Intelligence Agency opened many of its files to the public&#x2014;those known as &#x201c;the family jewels&#x201d;&#x2014;there were pages devoted to JFK&#x2019;s enthusiastic authorization of a CIA surveillance campaign against a well-known New York Times military affairs reporter who had published stories involving classified material. When Richard Nixon became president and authorized a similar leak-plugging operation, it was seen as the first step toward Watergate.<br><br>But in the wake of President Kennedy&#x2019;s violent death, America was in a state of shock, and the flaws or failings that were known to us only seemed to make him more human and his loss more deeply felt.<br><br>He became the prince of Camelot who left behind a widow whose beauty could not be compromised by grief, a woman not yet forty years old who would remain a part of our lives, in admiration and controversy, until she died in the closing days of the century. And their children, Caroline and John, Jr., now belonged to the nation as surely as the offspring of royalty.<br><br>Slowly, the rest of us went back to our ordinary lives, trying to absorb and understand the deep wounds we had sustained and the unimaginable loss we had suffered&#x2014;and blissfully unaware of all the tragedy and tumult that lay not far ahead. My wife, Meredith, finally found a job teaching English at Central High School in Omaha. We rented a better apartment; this one even had access to a swimming pool, which seemed to us the height of luxury. We watched The Dick Van Dyke Show and Gunsmoke on our new black-and-white television. We bought our first set of furniture&#x2014;sofa and matching chair, coffee table, dining room table and chairs, and two lamps&#x2014;for four hundred dollars.<br><br>In the summer of 1964, we drove east to visit Washington, D.C., and New York City on vacation, a couple of Midwesterners curious about life over the horizon from the Great Plains. In Washington, as luck would have it, we were in the press gallery when the House passed the historic Civil Rights Act, outlawing discrimination in jobs and public accommodations. Reporters were shouting into telephones and banging away at typewriters. We saw Roger Mudd, the CBS news correspondent who had been tracking the legislation nightly on the CBS Evening News, and Bob Abernethy of NBC News on the phone filing a radio report. I felt like a kid from the sticks who somehow managed to wander into Yankee Stadium while the World Series was under way.<br><br>We were thrilled, but a friend who worked for the congressman from Omaha was not; his boss had voted against the act. Another conservative friend from the Midwest insisted, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t legislate morality.&#x201d;<br><br>Huh? &#x201c;What about murder?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s immoral to kill someone. If I&#x2019;m not mistaken, we&#x2019;ve passed laws to deal with that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Existence</h2><p>OUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE WAS NEVER A GIVEN.

I&#x2019;ve left the light on over the stove for the past few days, since I&#x2019;ve been half expecting Dante to show up. Still, you never know who might have come in through an unlocked door. I get up quietly, throw a robe over my T&#x2013;shirt, and grab the cell phone in case I need to call 911. Then I creep down the hallway until I can peer into the lighted kitchen and determine whether what awaits me in the other room is a murderer or a lover.<br><br>It&#x2019;s the lover. Dante is standing with his back to me, drinking orange juice straight out of the carton. His black hair is greasy, tangled, and halfway down his back; he is shirtless, and I can see the pattern of his ribs through the roughened layer of skin. I wonder what creature he has been this time, and for how long. Where he has been staying, what he has been eating, if he has been in danger.<br><br>For a long time, I don&#x2019;t speak. I simply watch as he finishes off the juice and then opens the refrigerator door again. He&#x2019;s clearly ravenous. He rips open a package of cheese and consumes half the brick in two bites, still rummaging through Tupperware containers and wrapped serving bowls to find something to assuage his hunger. He actually grunts with pleasure when he finds the roast beef I defrosted and left on a plate on the bottom shelf. Setting the plate on the kitchen counter, he closes the refrigerator door and uses both hands to peel back the Saran Wrap, rolls a thick slice of beef, and eats it like a hot dog. He&#x2019;s halfway through the second piece before he stiffens all over and swings around to stare into the darkness of the corridor where I am hiding.<br><br>Just for a moment, I get the chance to see his face in full&#x2013;on feral intensity. My God, he is so beautiful. Beneath the grime and beard stubble, his skin is marble white; his deep&#x2013;set eyes are a dense and impenetrable brown. His mouth is full and heavy, his cheekbones deliberately planed. Black hair sweeps back from his forehead in a theatrical fall. He could have been an actor, a model, a muse, some rich woman&#x2019;s companion, if only his life had been a little different.<br><br>If only his life had been completely different.<br><br>&#x201c;Maria?&#x201d; he says in his low voice. It&#x2019;s not hard to imagine that voice dropping a few notes, losing its consonants, and coming out as a wordless growl.<br><br>He must realize that I am the likeliest presence to be standing a few feet away in the dark; but he sets his plate down, frees his hands for combat, and continues to stare in my direction. Until moments like this, I think that I would like to see him in one of his alternate forms sometime; but I always realize, in those few seconds before he recognizes me, that I really wouldn&#x2019;t. I am not afraid of him now, but I might be if I saw him in some other guise.<br><br>I step out of the shadows. &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You look so thin.&#x201d;<br><br>He glances down at his chest, bare except for a necklace made of a leather cord holding a single key. Indeed, he&#x2019;s much leaner than I like. And I see a new wound cutting through the thin, dark mat of hair on his chest. The cut has already healed, though not long ago. Sometime in the past month, Dante has been in pain and in peril.<br><br>He lifts his gaze again and smiles at me, an expression that always reminds why, despite everything, I love this man so much. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a tough few weeks,&#x201d; he admits.<br><br>I come closer. &#x201c;I see you found the beef,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s frozen pizza if you need some carbs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe later,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Protein&#x2019;s better for now.&#x201d;<br><br>This close, I get a pretty strong whiff of what I mentally describe as new Dante, the creature he always is when he first arrives. There&#x2019;s dirt and sweat and garbage and urine and some indefinable animal odor&#x2014;the sort of scent that surrounds a zoo on a hot day. It doesn&#x2019;t bother me as much as you might think. I want to get closer still, throw my arms around him, press my mouth against his, remind myself of his shape and his strength. He&#x2019;s always the one who holds back at first. I&#x2019;m never sure if it&#x2019;s the wild instincts making him shy away from human contact&#x2014;or his human instincts shunning his animalistic side, and trying to shield me from it at the same time.<br><br>He glances from my face to the plate of roast beef and back to my face. It&#x2019;s clear he&#x2019;s trying to determine if he&#x2019;s eaten enough to get him through the next few hours. &#x201c;I need a shower,&#x201d; he says, obviously deciding more food can wait. I step in his path as he heads for the doorway.<br><br>&#x201c;I need to kiss you,&#x201d; I say, holding him in place with my hand against his chest.<br><br>&#x201c;Maria&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just . . . a kiss.&#x201d;<br><br>He holds utterly still as I stretch up and touch my lips lightly to his, but beneath my hand I can feel his heartbeat kick up a notch. I press in a little harder, just enough so that his mouth responds to mine, and then I step away. I&#x2019;m smiling; he&#x2019;s not.<br><br>&#x201c;There are towels and clean clothes in the bathroom,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Want me to make you a meal?&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;s watching me with those unbelievable eyes. At times like this his expression is the most haunted, most unreadable. Is he sorry that he has disrupted my life so completely? Sorry he cannot exist beside me through ordinary days like an ordinary man? Sorry that he cannot stay away? Not sorry at all, merely roused to a passion he refuses to act upon until he has restored himself to some self&#x2013;imposed level of civilization? Or is he simply still hungry and thinking of nothing more than food?<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cook,&#x201d; he says, his voice even lower, throatier. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come rummage some more once I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d;<br><br>I nod and turn away to straighten up the little mess he&#x2019;s made. I don&#x2019;t hear him leave but I can tell when he&#x2019;s gone. Even when he&#x2019;s wearing shoes, which he isn&#x2019;t at the moment, he moves almost without sound. The only reason I know he has left the room is that I miss him already.<br><br>I busy myself in the kitchen for about ten minutes, putting away the meat, rinsing off some apples, making sure the sliced bread is out on the counter so he&#x2019;ll see it if he comes hunting for more food later on. But I can&#x2019;t stand being in the kitchen when he&#x2019;s somewhere else in the house. I lock the outside door, turn off the light, and feel my way down the dark corridor toward the bathroom. The door is open just enough to allow a little light and a lot of steam to escape.<br><br>I untie my robe, yank my T&#x2013;shirt over my head, step out of my panties. I leave all of these lying in the hall as I push the door open and step into the hot, foggy bathroom. I can see his silhouette, dark and blurred, behind the translucent glass of the shower door.<br><br>When I push it open and step inside, he spins around as if he is a woodland creature startled by a predator. Water sloshes over both of us, kicked up by his feet before it can swirl into the drain, streaming down from the nozzle overhead. It is almost too misty to see, but there is no missing Dante. I scoot carefully across the slippery porcelain of the tub, lifting my arms to twine around his neck. I can smell the toothpaste on his breath as I kiss him again. Water and soap make our skin slippery as our bodies come together. He is no longer resisting me; indeed, his arms close around me, hard, and he kisses me with a furious desire. The water continues to beat down on both of us as we make love in the shower until all the hot water is gone.<br><br>It is the first time I have felt fully alive since the last time I saw him.<br><br>I know Dante will sleep all day, so I go into work, even though I obviously didn&#x2019;t manage to get much rest the night before. Still, I hate to waste one of my few remaining vacation days moping around the house, waiting for him to get up.<br><br>I work as an accountant at a midsize firm in Eureka, Missouri, about forty minutes outside of downtown St. Louis. The company provides Web design and marketing support to regional businesses as far away as Arkansas. There are about twenty of us scattered throughout two stories; the creative people have offices on the top level, while the nuts&#x2013;and&#x2013;bolts people like me populate the ground floor. Still, it&#x2019;s impossible to work in such a small place and not be fairly well apprised of everyone else&#x2019;s business.<br><br>Today, all the gossip is about one of the secretaries, who came in with what looks suspiciously like a bruise under a heavy caking of foundation. It&#x2019;s not the first time. We all suspect she&#x2019;s being abused by her husband, but whenever someone tries to approach her on the topic, she refuses to speak to us, on that subject or any other. There are several of us who feel like we&#x2019;re failing her as friends and human beings, and we constantly debate what we should be doing for her. I have seen up close the effects of domestic violence; I know how badly such a situation can end. But I have no more clue about how to help Kathleen than anyone else does.<br><br>The office manager drops by my desk around ten, just as I&#x2019;m yawning over the same spreadsheet that I&#x2019;ve been staring at for the past half hour. She perches on the edge of my desk, which is something of a feat since her clothes are exceedingly tight and her skirt is exceedingly short. She&#x2019;s a well&#x2013;endowed, fiftyish woman with garishly blond hair. She looks like she should be serving coffee at a diner and wearing a name tag that identifies her as PEARL or JOLENE, but, in fact, her name is Ellen. I simply love her.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I stopped to talk to Kathleen for a few minutes this morning and asked how she was doing. Said I thought she looked kind of unwell, and wanted to know if she needed anything or wanted to talk about anything,&#x201d; Ellen says. I always mentally fill in the pauses in her speech by imagining her taking a drag on a cigarette. She says she hasn&#x2019;t lit up in more than a decade, but you can tell, by the hungry way she watches other smokers, that she still wants to.<br><br>&#x201c;Did she tell you to mind your own business?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her expression said, &#x2019;Fuck off, bitch,&#x2019; but you know Kathleen. Not the swearing type,&#x201d; Ellen replies. &#x201c;She just said she was fine, a little tired, and then she started going through her mail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all going to feel terrible someday when we learn she&#x2019;s been murdered by her husband.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, Ritchie&#x2019;s too chicken&#x2013;shit to kill her. He&#x2019;d rather beat her up for the next thirty years than try to break in a new rag doll.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even if you got her to talk to you, even if you got her to leave him, she&#x2019;d probably just go back to him. What&#x2019;s the statistic about the numbers of abused wives who return to their husbands?&#x201d;<br><br>Ellen shrugs. She&#x2019;s said before that she doesn&#x2019;t care much about statistics, she cares about stories. Every time she says it, I think, You&#x2019;d really love mine. &#x201c;And even if she left him, even if she got a divorce, there&#x2019;s no saying that he wouldn&#x2019;t track her down and kill her anyway,&#x201d; she points out. &#x201c;Happens all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re depressing me,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;and it&#x2019;s not even ten in the morning yet.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughs and pushes herself away from my desk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go make a few calls. I&#x2019;ve got a friend who&#x2019;s a social worker. Maybe she&#x2019;ll have some ideas about how I should talk to Kathleen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But if it won&#x2019;t do any good&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Ellen shrugs. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gotta live with him. I&#x2019;ve gotta live with myself. I have to try.&#x201d; At the door, she turns back. &#x201c;You feel like going out for lunch today? I left my brown bag at home on the kitchen counter. The cats are gonna have a field day with the tuna salad sandwich.&#x201d;<br><br>I hadn&#x2019;t had time to make lunch, since I&#x2019;d waited till the last possible moment to get out of bed, so I&#x2019;m delighted by the suggestion. &#x201c;That would be great! Come get me whenever you&#x2019;re hungry.&#x201d;<br><br>We end up at a wannabe Friday&#x2019;s two blocks over. It serves mediocre food but it&#x2019;s only a short walk away, which makes it a popular choice with those who work in our building. I order a hamburger, causing Ellen to give me a knowing look.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be having your period,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You only eat meat about once a month.&#x201d;<br><br>I laugh and nod, although, in fact, I am midway through my cycle. It&#x2019;s true that I rarely eat meat, but that&#x2019;s because of Dante. I&#x2019;m not always certain what animal shape he will take when he&#x2019;s away from me. What if he has chosen to become a pig or a cow? I can&#x2019;t stand the idea that someone could slaughter him and turn him into a Big Mac or a BLT. Only after I know he is alive and human again&#x2014;only when he is at home in my bed&#x2014;will I abandon my vegetarian diet.<br><br>Ellen and I have just given our orders when we&#x2019;re joined by Marquez, a copywriter in the creative department, who simply saunters over and pulls up a chair. Besides Ellen, he&#x2019;s my closest friend at the office. He&#x2019;s a soft man with a paunchy stomach, a doughy face, a gentle voice, and an endearing smile. He makes no secret of the fact that he&#x2019;s gay, though I think he&#x2019;s between relationships at the moment; he isn&#x2019;t very forthcoming with the details of his love life. He is, however, perfectly willing to discuss everyone else&#x2019;s love life, a topic that Ellen and I also find endlessly fascinating.<br><br>After we speculate about Kathleen for a few minutes, we turn our attention to Marquez&#x2019;s boss, an icy, regal woman with striking good looks who keeps her dark hair short and blunt and never wears anything but black.<br><br>&#x201c;As God is my witness, I think she&#x2019;s having an affair with Grant Vance,&#x201d; Marquez says. Grant is a good&#x2013;looking African&#x2013;American who handles customer relations and has never, as far as I&#x2019;ve determined from personal observation, been in a bad mood.<br><br>&#x201c;Grant Vance is young enough to be her son!&#x201d; Ellen exclaims.<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d guess he&#x2019;s thirty, but how old is Caroline? Forty?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My age, and I turned fifty&#x2013;two last year,&#x201d; Ellen says.<br><br>Marquez is nodding at me when I look skeptical. &#x201c;We had a party for her two years ago. The big five&#x2013;oh,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, so what? Men date younger women all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care who sleeps with who as long as they don&#x2019;t want me to watch it on TV,&#x201d; Ellen says. &#x201c;But I would never have picked Grant and Caroline.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What makes you so sure?&#x201d; I ask Marquez. &#x201c;I mean&#x2014;he&#x2019;s such a puppy dog. Big and friendly and goofy. Caroline&#x2019;s like Cruella de Vil&#x2019;s mean older sister.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Caroline likes to order men around,&#x201d; Marquez say cynically. &#x201c;I think puppy dogs appeal to her. She can train them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Turn them into pit bulls,&#x201d; Ellen says with a snort. Caroline is about the only person that I have ever heard Ellen admit to disliking. In general, Ellen is so entertained by the antics of the human race that she enjoys everybody&#x2019;s company.<br><br>&#x201c;But are you sure? She&#x2019;s married, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; I say.<br><br>They each give me a look of derision. &#x201c;What world do you live in?&#x201d; Marquez demands. &#x201c;Married people have sex all the time with individuals who are not their spouses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She just seems so cold and dispassionate,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I mean, not the kind of person who would want an affair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes it&#x2019;s not about sex, it&#x2019;s about power,&#x201d; Marquez says.<br><br>&#x201c;People always say stuff like that, and I don&#x2019;t know why,&#x201d; Ellen replies, just as the waitress brings our food. &#x201c;Sex is pretty damn good all on its own without having to be about anything else.&#x201d;<br><br>I would have laughed anyway, but the look on the waitress&#x2019;s face makes it impossible for me to stop giggling. Marquez is grinning. None of us speak again until the girl leaves, giving us one last disgusted look before she marches away. She&#x2019;s about eighteen; I think she&#x2019;s repulsed by the notion that anyone as old as we are might still be indulging in carnal acts.<br><br>&#x201c;But you never told us,&#x201d; Ellen says, speaking around a mouthful of food. &#x201c;Why do you think Grant and Caroline are getting it on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He licked her face,&#x201d; M...</p><h2>Sidewalks sing (HBJ treasury of literature)</h2><p>Ex-library book, some pencil marks, and mark on the spine, slight corner wear.</p><p></p><h2>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Vol. 4-6 (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>The first three volumes of Gibbon&#39;s Decline And Fall (the western empire) were published by Everyman in 1993.

The six-volume Everyman edition - the only complete one now available-prints the entire text of the book with all Gibbon&#39;s own notes, later editorial commentaries, maps, tables, descriptive tables of contents, indices, appendices and two magisterial essays on the author and his work by Hugh Trevor-Roper.</p><p></p><h2>The Traveler: An Event Group Thriller (Event Group Thrillers, 11)</h2><p><p>267,000 BCE.

His statistical analysis of bud shapes, begun in the 1960s, leads him to suggest that all living forms are affected by patterns in time as well as space, with all of life and nature passing through vast cycles of change. He proposes that there are universal laws, not yet fully understood, which guide an organism&#39;s growth into predetermined patterns. He gives a detailed account of a complex phenomena which has hitherto not been observed or described. Edward&#39;s pioneering work into bud shapes has already attracted the attention of many scientists around the world and the implications of his work may lead to a revision of our current scientific worldview. Though written for the lay reader the book includes an appendix of his research and data.</p><p>Lawrence Edwards is a retired teacher of mathematics. He has been pursuing his unique and fascinating research for over thirty years, focusing on the forms of living nature in their relationship to geometric analysis. He has lectured widely on his research, to both specialist and non-specialist audiences, in Europe, America, and Australasia.&#39;Stylistically the book is somewhat removed from scientific writing. Indeed, in places, it borders on autobiography. But this adds to its vividness...What is clear...is that Edwards has left posterity with a clear account of his research and methods. The research raises many questions which become challenges for whoever wishes to take this work further.&#39; --David Heaf, New View, Autumn 2006</p><h2>Mr. Bliss</h2><p>2nd printing of this edition, dust jacket creased and worn, bookseller&#39;s pencil marks.

Collaborating with Delsohn, who also worked with Dan Marino and Eric Dickerson on their life stories, the former defensive lineman, now a movie and TV actor, addresses many of the same subjects that other football players have in their books. He tells of suffering constant pain throughout the season; the willingness, even eagerness, to play despite pain, not because of machismo, but because of the fear of being replaced permanently; the anguish of forming friendships on a team, only to have friends traded away. He sheds little new light on these topics or on that of the groupies who flock around ball players. The best part of the book concerns Matuszak's adolescence and the problems of growing up as a huge kid. 35,000 first printing; $40,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eminent Churchillians</h2><p>Offers a look at key Churchillians and their secrets</p><p>Andrew Roberts took a first in Modern History at Cambridge.

Emily, now in her 30s, is living in Los Angeles with a husband and a career as an image consultant&#x2014;a career that is suddenly floundering&#x2014;when she gets a desperate summons to Greenwich, Connecticut, from her old friend Miriam. Miriam&#x2019;s pal Karolina is all over the media with a bogus drunk driving change, and this senator&#x2019;s wife and former Victoria&#x2019;s Secret model needs an image makeover, fast. The narrative is split between the three women as they uncover a major betrayal and in doing so form an enviable bond. The doings of the Greenwich housewives who are now shunning Karolina is uproariously funny, and even jaded Emily is shocked by the scandalous behavior going on behind oversized doors. It feels like Weisberger wrote her novel yesterday, peppering the story with real-life celebrity misconduct. <em>When Life Gives You Lululemons</em> is a laugh-out-loud funny look at rich people behaving badly and the steel bonds of true female friendship. &#x2014;<em>Seira Wilson, Amazon Book Review</em>Lauren Weisberger is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>When Life Gives You Lululemons</i>, <i>The Singles Game</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, which was published in forty languages and made into a major motion picture starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway.

Yet Frederick Douglasss assertion that Lincoln was the white mans president has been used by some detractors as proof of his fundamentally racist character. Viewed objectively, Lincoln was a white mans president by virtue of his own whiteness and that of the culture that produced him. Until now, however, historians have rarely explored just what this means for our understanding of the man and his actions.<br>Writing at the vanguard of whiteness studies, Brian Dirck considers Lincoln as a typical American white man of his time who bore the multiple assumptions, prejudices, and limitations of his own racial identity. He shows us a Lincoln less willing or able to transcend those limitations than his more heroic persona might suggest but also contends that Lincolns understanding and approach to racial bigotry was more enlightened than those of most of his white contemporaries. <br><br>Blazing a new trail in Lincoln studies, Dirck reveals that Lincoln was well aware of and sympathetic to white fears, especially that of descending into white trash, a notion that gnawed at a man eager to distance himself from his own coarse origins. But he also shows that after Lincoln crossed the Rubicon of black emancipation, he continued to grow beyond such cultural constraints, as seen in his seven recorded encounters with nonwhites. <br><br>Dirck probes more deeply into what white meant in Lincolns time and what it meant to Lincoln himself, and from this perspective he proposes a new understanding of how Lincoln viewed whiteness as a distinct racial category that influenced his policies. As Dirck ably demonstrates, Lincoln rose far enough above the confines of his culture to accomplish deeds still worthy of our admiration, and he calls for a more critically informed admiration of Lincoln that allows us to celebrate his considerable accomplishments while simultaneously recognizing his limitations. <br><br>When Douglass observed that Lincoln was the white mans president, he may not have intended it as a serious analytical category. But, as Dirck shows, perhaps we should do so&#x2014;the better to understand not just the Lincoln presidency, but the man himself.</p><p>Brian R. Dirck is professor of history at Anderson University, author of <i>Lincoln &amp; Davis: Imagining America, 1809 1865</i> and <i>Lincoln the Lawyer,</i> and editor of <i>Lincoln Emancipated: The President and the Politics of Race</i>."Excellent."&#x2014;<b><i>Journal of American History</i></b><p>"A deftly written and groundbreaking work that carefully puts Lincoln's racial attitudes in historical context, this volume is highly recommended to anyone interested in the Civil War or the history of race in America."&#x2014;<i><b>Civil War History</b></i></p><p>"There is much to appreciate in this clear and careful examination of Lincoln's understanding of race in general and whiteness in particular. While one may not always agree with Dirck's conclusions, one can always follow what questions he asked of the evidence to come to the insights he presents. It may be profitably used in undergraduate or graduate courses on Lincoln, the civil War, and the early to mid-nineteenth century."&#x2014;<i><b>Fides et Historia</b></i><br><br>Most historians writing about Lincoln have overlooked the significance of his racial identity. Without being tendentious or overly theoretical, Dirck carefully puts Lincolns whiteness into historical context. Its an approach so obviously useful to understanding Lincoln that future generations will be amazed it took so long for someone to write such a book.&#x2014;<b>Gerald J. Prokopowicz</b>, author of <i>Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln</i></p><p>An imaginative work. Dirck has a true historians feel for the culture in which Lincoln was born and bred&#x2014;its language, its folk customs, and, most important, its racial assumptions.&#x2014;<b>James Oakes</b>, author of <i>The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery</i></p></p><h2>Surprisingly Simple Quilts: From Australian Patchwork &amp; Quilting Magazine (That Patchwork Place)</h2><p>Add beauty and brilliance to quilts without all the work!

He chose it mainly because he liked the alliteration it contained. At the same time he did, however, agree that the music evokes "a pavane that a little princess once might have danced at the Spanish court". Following its premiere in 1902 the simple but effective piece gained unparalleled popularity, not least reflected in the numerous arrangements made of it, one of which, for small orchestra, was by Ravel himself.</p><p> Publisher ID: HN1260<br> Instrumentation: Piano<br> Urtext / Critical Edition<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Go Away Big Green Monster</h2><p>Caldecott Award-winning author-artist Ed Emberley has created an ingenious way for children to chase away their nighttime fears. Kids can turn the pages of this die-cut book and watch the Big Green Monster grow. Then, when they&#39;re ready to show him who&#39;s in charge, they&#39;ll turn the remaining pages and watch him disappear! This lavish reissue features dramatic die-cut eyes and sparkling foil on the cover.</p><p>Ed Emberley is the illustrator and author of over 80 books, including the bestselling <em>Go Away, Big Green Monster! </em>and his enormously popular "Drawing Book" series. He has received many awards and accolades, including a Caldecott Honor in 1967 for<em> One Wide River to Cross </em>and a Caldecott Medal in 1968 for <em>Drummer Hoff.</em> Ed Emberley lives in Ipswich, Massachusetts, with his wife, Barbara. You can visit him online at www.edemberley.com.PreSchool-- A graphic delight. In the tradition of Lois Ehlert's Color Zoo (1989) and Color Farm (1990, both HarperCollins), this is a clever series of die-cut pages that lets children construct and then deconstruct a big green monster. The book starts with a black page, and two round eyes gleaming through the text. "Big Green Monster has two big yellow eyes." Each page adds a new adjective-laden element, including a "long bluish-greenish nose" and "scraggy purple hair" until the culmination of effects prompts a response of, "YOU DON'T SCARE ME! SO GO AWAY . . . ." Each subsequent page subtracts one of the scary pieces until the last page is entirely black, featuring the words, "and DON'T COME BACK! Until I say so." This imaginative original work is a most friendly way in which children can take control over their own "monsters" or nightmares. It also has great visual appeal because of the bold interplay between shape and color. --Elizabeth Hanson, Chicago Public Library<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kharkov 1942: Anatomy of a Military Disaster Through Soviet Eyes</h2><p>In May 1942 the powerful German Wehrmacht and the massive Soviet Red Army were engaged in a bitter struggle. The initially rapid advance of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union against the Red Army had been halted by the spring of 1941. Red Army counteroffensives had stopped the German advance at Moscow by the spring of 1942 and the Soviet leadership was convinced the Wehrmacht was fatally stretched. A counterthrust by the Red Army at the southern end of the front line, near the town of Kharkov, would, they imagined, be a vital step in pushing the German Army back. The reality was very different. Soviet overconfidence meant that hundreds of thousands of their soldiers lost their lives in one of the most catastrophic offensives in Russian military history. For over half a century the Soviets kept the scale of their defeat secret. Only in the last decade were the documents made generally available.</p><p>David M.

He is currently the director of Double Exposure, one of the United Kingdom&#39;s foremost producers of factual and educational programs.Obsessed with the "narrative quality" and linguistic challenge of cryptic crosswords, London-based TV journalist Balfour sees them as an eloquent metaphor for life: "Crosswords tell stories about ourselves. Crosswords express our humanity.... And British crosswords do it better than any others." In 1983, aged 21, Balfour left his native South Africa, seeking "a bigger world out there, a world where ideas have greater currency, and where words mean more." Journeying in Europe, Africa and America, he became increasingly fascinated with cryptic crosswords, which he links to his travel tales: "We take a bus to the outskirts of Zagreb. Years later I see a clue for Zagreb in the Independent." Headed to Moscow, he took "three pieces of identity"-his South African ID document, his passport and an anthology of Guardian crosswords. He spoke with many crossword "setters," and some may wish for lengthier profiles of these erudite editors plus more anecdotes such as the one about a man who proposed marriage via clues hidden in a 1998 New York Times puzzle. The reader is introduced to the working methods of the Guardian's clever, prolific setter who uses the name Araucaria and has produced more than 57,000 puzzles. In Balfour's polished prose, "every word is pregnant with possibility." Doubly lit with wit, this memoir of layered meanings is written with the realization that "the invisible web of words that binds all knowledge is something real and tangible."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Inuyasha Ani-Manga, Vol. 13</h2><p>Pulled back in time to Japan&#39;s ancient past, Japanese high school girl Kagome finds her destiny linked to a doglike half-demon named Inu-Yasha, who remembers Kagome&#39;s previous incarnation as the woman who killed him - and to the Shikon Jewel, or &#34;Jewel of Four Souls,&#34; which can fulfill the greatest dreams of any man or monster. Now Kagome and Inu-Yasha must work together to search for the scattered shards of the jewel before everyone&#39;s nightmares are given the power the need to come true.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi&#39;s career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan&#39;s annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film.&#34;</p><h2>Earthly Joys</h2><p>Sweeping historical novel from Philippa Gregory the author of The Other Boleyn Girl and The Virgin&#39;s Lover.

Works that have been adapted for television include A Respectable Trade, The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen&#39;s Fool. The Other Boleyn Girl is now a major film, starring Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and Eric Bana. Philippa Gregory lives in the North of England with her family.The order of a 17th-century English garden stands in contradiction to the dissolution of a plague- and hunger-ridden land ruled by greedy Stuart kings and immoral courtiers. Gregory's (Wideacre) latest historical novel follows gardener John Tradescant, whose life entwines with the chaotic history of his time. Tradescant is in his 30s when he goes to work for King James's trusted adviser Robert Cecil, then observes the degradation as power passes from the honorable Cecil to the seductive, sexually cynical Duke of Buckingham. Tradescant's wife and son are suspicious of the pro-Catholic views of the court. Puritanical by nature, they conduct an ongoing argument with John about who owes allegiance where. The need for bright perfection?a garden where nothing fades or dies?requires enormous labor, a visibly costly attempt to impose decorative order on wilderness. For the gardener, the question of loyalty is initially simple, but his family is appalled by court excesses as people are taxed and slowly starved. The population grows more restive as court arrogance increases. This is a powerful parable for any period of history, but here the details of home life, travel and the attitudes toward human worth make it a potent statement about Stuart absolutism, pre-Restoration chaos and an empire on the cusp of colonization and trade. Gregory's skills as a storyteller give these issues a human focus and result in an absorbing narrative. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Face of Chaos (Thieves World #5)</h2><p>Short stories portray the adventures of swordmen, petty thieves, and wizards, who come to the small town of Sanctuary</p><p>Robert (Lynn) Asprin was born in 1946.

White is a journalist and the author of Chain Chain Change: For Black Women in Abusive Relationships and The Black Women&#39;s Health Book. She lives in Oakland, California.In this vibrant narrative, White strives to go beyond simply mapping the movements and accomplishments of the first black female Pulitzer Prize winner. While White relies heavily on interviews with Alice Walker (b. 1944), her family and friends, the stories are always told in a historical context. Walker's childhood as a daughter of Georgia sharecroppers is framed by what it meant to be a poor black female in the Jim Crow South. White particularly focuses on an accident that transforms the eight-year-old Walker from talkative and precocious to introverted and sad. Walker was shot with a BB gun and left disfigured and blind in one eye, and her father was refused a ride to transport the injured girl into town and swindled out of $250 by a white doctor. These events, according to White, brought the young Walker to a new level of understanding of the inhumanity of Southern racism and later moved her to search and reveal, through her writings, the depths of human suffering. This understanding also drove Walker to become active in various causes, most notably the Civil Rights and black feminist movements. From beginning to end, White (<i>The Black Women's Health Book</i>), in her first biography, meticulously traces and analyzes the stages of Walker's life, emphasizing the impact on and importance of her literature in American culture. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Various sections of the three volumes describe the arrest, interrogation, conviction, transportation, and imprisonment of the Gulag's victims by Soviet authorities over four decades. The work mingles historical exposition and Solzhenitsyn's own autobiographical accounts with the voluminous personal testimony of other inmates that he collected and committed to memory during his imprisonment.Upon publication of the first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago, </i> Solzhenitsyn was immediately attacked in the Soviet press. Despite the intense interest in his fate that was shown in the West, he was arrested and charged with treason on February 12, 1974, and was exiled from the Soviet Union the following day.</p><p><b>Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn</b> was born into a family of Cossack intellectuals in Kislovodsk, Russia, in 1918. He fought for the Soviet Union in World War II, achieving the rank of captain of artillery. In 1945 he was arrested for writing a letter in which he criticized Joseph Stalin and spent eight years in prisons and labor camps. In 1956 he was allowed to settle in Ryazan, in central Russia, where he became a mathematics teacher and began to write. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. Following the publication of the first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago, </i> he was exiled in 1974. His Soviet citizenship was restored in 1990 and he returned to Russia in 1994, where he now lives.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Along the Road: Notes and Essays of a Tourist (Ecco Travels)</h2><p>Discusses the regions of Europe as encountered on the author&#39;s travels through the continent, and considers their art, music, and literature</p><p></p><h2>Ghost Hunting: True Stories of Unexplained Phenomena from The Atlantic Paranormal Society</h2><p>The real-life adventures of the paranormal investigators-slash-plumbers who star in the #1 hit Sci Fi Channel television show <i>Ghost Hunters</i>.<br><br>The Atlantic Paranormal Society, also known as T.A.P.S., is the brainchild of two plumbers by day, paranormal investigators by night: Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson.

Ten of his titles have appeared on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list.

On those rare occasions when he visits the real world, Friedman lives on Long Island with his wife and two sons.At The Atlantic Paranormal Society (T.A.P.S. for short), we typically start our investigations with a question: Does this case merit our attention? The answer is usually dependent on a second question: Does the person who believes he or she has paranormal activity truly need our help? That's our primary goal -- to help.<p>If people think they've seen a ghost, heard an unexplained noise, or found things moved out of place and they're concerned about it, we'll pack up our vehicles, bring in our equipment to document the activity, and, if necessary, even bless the place. We do believe there are supernatural entities, both benign and destructive, but before we accept that a house or building is haunted we check out every possible angle.</p><p>I'm inclined to be especially sensitive to those clients who see paranormal phenomena and believe they're losing their minds, as I'll explain in a moment. But the decision to go on a job is not mine alone. It involves my partner, Grant Wilson, as well. Grant and I developed T.A.P.S. together, so we rely on each other's perspectives. He's like a brother to me and has been almost from the day we met.</p><p>At the time, I was twenty-two, a couple of years removed from my first paranormal experience. At the age of twenty, I had gotten involved with a lady who practiced Reiki, a Japanese technique for stress reduction, relaxation, and healing that depends on the manipulation of a person's life-force energy.</p><p>At first, I was skeptical about the idea of life-force energy. Then, after six months or so of exposure to the technique, I started seeing things. Usually it started with a mist, out of which emanated a dim light, and then out of the light came other things -- including see-through animals and full-body human apparitions.</p><p>I would point them out to whoever was with me, but no one else seemed to see them. They looked at me like I was crazy, and frankly, that was how I looked at myself. I felt like I was honestly and truly losing my mind.</p><p>It was scary as all get-out. I didn't know where to turn. Then a friend introduced me to a guy named John Zaffis, who was known as a paranormal researcher in Connecticut. Zaffis ran some tests and determined that I was becoming sensitive to paranormal phenomena.</p><p>That was a whole lot better than going crazy, but it was far from comforting. I was still seeing things I didn't want to see. And Zaffis, who lived three hours away, couldn't work with me as often as I would have liked. At his suggestion, I started the Rhode Island Paranormal Society, which came to be known as RIPS.</p><p>It wasn't a ghost-hunting organization like T.A.P.S., at least not at first. It was more of a support group. I was trying to connect with people who had gone through experiences similar to mine, hoping they could help me deal with my sensitivity and shut it off. I ended up meeting people all right, many more than I would have imagined.</p><p>But none of them knew how to help me.</p><p>Then, one day in the aquarium at Mystic, Connecticut, a woman in her fifties came up to me out of nowhere and asked in a tender, almost intimate way, "How are you doing?"</p><p>It was a strange question to ask someone she had never met. Before I could answer her, she continued. "Hon," she said, "you're seeing things, I know. But you can make it stop. Try green olives. I'll see you again soon." Then she walked away. I was too dumbfounded to stop her and ask her how she knew about my problem.</p><p>Stranger still, the green olive approach worked. I ate those suckers all day long, a bottle a day, and the visions I'd been having went away. I wasn't cured for life, because whenever I stopped eating olives the visions came back. But at least I had found a way to alleviate the symptoms.</p><p>In the meantime, my RIPS group had taken on a life of its own, blustering its way into graveyards and abandoned buildings with a couple of cameras, a tape recorder, and a whole lot of optimism. We caught a few EVPs now and then, but I can't say they were anything of merit.</p><p>EVPs, by the way, are electronic voice phenomena. When a ghost hunter enters a room, he always asks any paranormal entity for a sign of its presence. Even if an entity is there, listening, and inclined to answer, its response isn't always audible to the human ear. Sometimes it can only be picked up on a sound recording device and discovered later on, when you're going over your tapes or digital impressions.</p><p>EVPs have been part of the paranormal investigator's repertoire since their inadvertent discovery in the 1950s by a man recording birdsongs. To his surprise, he got human voices instead.</p><p>The other thing RIPS seemed to capture a lot was orb activity. An orb is a round, translucent, mobile packet of energy thought to signal supernatural activity in some way. However, people often mistake naturally occurring phenomena like dust, bugs, light reflections, and condensation for orbs. It wasn't at all uncommon for someone in RIPS to "prove" a haunting because he had caught some "orbs" with his camera, when in fact they'd been floating particles of dust and there hadn't been a ghost within fifty miles of the place.</p><p>RIPS also visited some homes, responding to residents who wanted to know if they were living with supernatural entities. I remember one Connecticut case in particular -- not because of any significant paranormal activity but because while I was there I ran into the woman I had met in the Mystic aquarium. Like us, she was checking out the house for signs of haunting.</p><p>It was a strange moment. But then, she had said we would meet again. I made sure to thank her for the olive idea.</p><p>About that same time, I got a call from a guy who had seen our rinky-dink RIPS website and said he could improve on it, make it nicer-looking and more functional. In fact, he was willing to redesign it for free. He just wanted to add it to his portfolio so he could get other work in the future.</p><p>It was a hard deal to beat. I met with him at a local place called Bess Eaton Doughnuts. I remember him bringing his good friend Chris. I also remember wondering if it wasreally the website he wanted to talk about, because theconversation kept drifting off in the direction of personal experiences with the paranormal.</p><p>It was outside the doughnut place, as we were talking alongside my Subaru, that the guy finally came clean. He had had an experience of his own -- a recurring one, from the time he was fifteen until he turned seventeen and went to college. An intense experience in the heavily wooded part of Rhode Island where he had been raised. And every once in a while, the experience still popped up.</p><p>The guy was Grant Wilson.</p><p>His friend Chris verified everything he said, mentioning tests he and Grant's other friends had put him through to determine if his experience had been real. I'd be more specific, but Grant doesn't like to say much about what happened. It's kind of a touchy subject with him.</p><p>Anyway, our conversation left the parking lot and continued in my living room. We sat there for hours discussing our philosophies about the paranormal, and we found a lot of common ground. This went on for days, then weeks. Finally I said, "Screw the rest of what's out there," referring to other ghost hunters and their methods. "Let's do it our way."</p><p>You see, most groups then -- like now -- were running around saying everything is haunted. They didn't worry about collecting evidence. They just walked into people's houses, got in touch with their feelings, and decided there were ghostly presences afoot. In fact, they never found a place that wasn't haunted.</p><p>Grant and I insisted on a more rational approach. Before we would ever say a place was home to a supernatural entity, we needed to have proof. It was a significant departure. And it was on that basis that we founded T.A.P.S. -- both of us, because the idea was as much Grant's as mine.</p><p>Grant said it best: "If you set out to prove a haunting, anything will seem like evidence. If you set out to disprove it, you'll end up with only those things you can't explain away."</p><p>Right from the beginning, we found people with similar philosophies. Our T.A.P.S. website (designed by Grant, of course) got two hundred hits a day, at a time when that was a pretty impressive number. And the total kept climbing. Two years later, we were up to two thousand hits a day.</p><p>Other groups looked for publicity, seeking out the media on Halloween and so on. We never did that. But we still wound up building a substantial network of like-minded ghost hunters, people who were inclined to approach the supernatural with a certain amount of discrimination.</p><p>And soon we weren't just getting calls from people in the New England area. People were reaching out to us from California and Michigan and Louisiana. Unfortunately, we didn't have the money to travel out there and help them, and we also didn't have reliable contacts in other parts of the country to whom we could refer them..</p><p>Grant and I decided that in order to extend our contact network, we first had to separate the people who saw things our way from those who didn't, and the best way to do that was by being controversial. So we put up an article on our website that essentially said orbs were trash.</p><p>Now, orbs were really popular in those days. Hearing they were insignificant was, for some people, a slap in the face. They railed back at us, telling us we were crazy, and the battle was on. The paranormal field was polarized almost overnight.</p><p>But we found the people we were looking for.</p><p>The first one was Al Tyas at D.C. Metro Area Ghost Watchers (affectionately known as D.C. MAG). Al saw things the way we did and became a big part of the T.A.P.S. extended family. We got support from other places as well, across the country and even overseas. People from Europe, Asia, and Australia were contacting us to thank us for taking a stand.</p><p>As our network continued to expand and our organization grew, Grant and I cut a deal. He would take care of the creative and technical facets of our organization, areas where he's the undisputed king. I would handle the management and business aspects. Among my responsibilities was making sure we brought...</p></p><h2>Nemesis. Translated from the Norwegian by Don Bartlett</h2><p>THE NEXT STIEG LARSSON&#39; INDEPENDENT.

They have been placed together in this opening volume of his Collected Writings as the best introduction to his thought on wide range of Christian truth. Murray's belief was that, while the expression of truth 'may be expanded indefinitely and furnish nourishment for the highest intellects to eternity', it is also capable of presentation in popular and generally-understood terms. Accordingly, he speaks in these pages not so much to students as to the church at large in this critical century of her history. Such chapters as 'Some Necessary Emphases in Preaching', The Power of the Holy Spirit', and The Church of Mission', show how thoroughly he understood the great inadequacies of much contemporary Christianity.<br>This material (none of which has been previously published in book form) gives the quintessence of the convictions which were characteristic of his mature thought. Their appeal in written form is increased by the pervasive influence of his belief that theology should be 'shot through with warmth of ardent devotion'. He addresses himself to the needs of both mind and heart, believing that when Scripture is opened there should be both light and heat. His overriding concern is that the Word of God should challenge every area where thinking and living can be shown to be deficient and that the traditions of men should give way to 'the claims of truth'.</p><p>Professor John Murray (1898-1975) was recognized in his own lifetime as one of the leading Reformed theologians in the English-speaking world. Born at Migdale, near Bonar Bridge, Scotland, he attended Dornoch Academy, and served with the Royal Highlanders (Black Watch) in France during the First World War, losing an eye in the conflict. After the War, he pursued studies, first at the University of Glasgow (MA, 1923), and then at Princeton Theological Seminary, USA (1924-27). In 1929 he was invited to teach Systematic Theology at Princeton, and did so for one year, before joining the Faculty of the newly formed Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. There he shared with such scholars and Christian leaders as J. Gresham Machen and Cornelius Van Til in the great struggle to maintain the old Princeton tradition in theology, represented by the Hodges and B. B. Warfield. He was ordained in 1937 by the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, USA. John Murray remained at Westminster until his retirement in 1966. He returned to his native Scotland, married Valerie Knowlton in December 1967 and enjoyed a brief period of fatherhood prior to his death in 1975. A careful scholar, an eloquent lecturer, a moving preacher, and the author of many outstanding articles and books, Murray&#39;s driving passions were to declare Christ s Word, advance his cause, and bless his people.</p><h2>Intercepted By Christ: A Journey Into Spiritual Growth Based on the Life of Steve Bartkowski</h2><p>A Journey Into Spiritual Growth Based on the Life of Steve Bartkowski, then quarterback for the Atlantic Falcons.

Being prayerful,one&#39;s response to varying situations would be effective without one being in anyway affected.This attitude also helps one to accept one&#39;s past,as well as the present situation.The more prayerful one is,the freer one becomes from guilt,hurt,and from self-loath.In the wake of graceful acceptance,there is serenity.&#34;</p><p>Swami Dayananda Saraswati is a contemporary teacher of Vedanta and a scholar in Sanskrit in the tradition of Sankara. Swamiji has been teaching Vedanta in India for more than five decades and around the world since 1976. His deep scholarship and assimilation of Vedanta combined with a subtle appreciation of contemporary problems make him that rare teacher who can reach both traditional and modern students. A teacher of teachers, Swami Dayananda taught six resident in-depth Vedanta courses, each spanning 30 to 36 months. Four of them were conducted in India and two in the United States. Each course graduated about 60 qualified teachers, who are now teaching throughout India and abroad. Under his guidance, various centers for teaching of Vedanta have been founded around the world; among these, there are three primary centers in India at Rishikesh, Coimbatore, Nagpur and one in the U.S. at Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. There are more than one hundred centers in India and abroad that carry on the same tradition of Vedantic teaching. In addition to teaching, Swami Dayananda has initiated and supported various humanitarian efforts for the last forty-five years. The most far-reaching of these is the establishment of All India Movement for Seva in 2000. Awarded consultative status with ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council) by the United Nations in 2005, this organization is devoted to serving people in the remote areas of India, mainly in the field of Education and Health Care. Swami Dayananda Saraswati has also promoted several international events and participated as a speaker in several global forums, among which are: the United Nations gathering of NGO&#39;s, the UNESCO Seoul Global Convention, the United Nations 50th Anniversary Celebration, the Millennium World Peace Summit, the International Congress for the Preservation of Religious Diversity, the Conference on the Preservation of Sacred Sites, the World Council for Preservation of Religious Diversity, the Youth Peace Summit, the Global Peace Initiative of Women Religious and Spiritual Leaders, a Hindu-Christian dialogue with the World Council of Churches, and the Hindu-Jewish Leadership Summit.</p><h2>A history of taxation and expenditure in the Western world</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

The accent is on character. There's feisty old Hanby Crumb, who boasts of having been the favorite of Pancho Villa; lawman Leo Sparks, who conducts an endless feud with the town's most detested family; the bumbling Slaven Budd whose one talent is that he can "talk dog"; the wild and tragic Audie Renkin who wins from five men at a poker game more money than they are prepared to lose. Other stories feature life on a prison farm, the strange sport of fox racing, a fastball that goes out of control, a trombonist who drinks too much and, in a manner both quaint and slightly sinister, some kids who dress up in the garb of the Ku Klux Klan. Jones (Roman, Elkhorn Tavern, etc.) has supplied his own expressive drawings to go with this most engaging collection. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Shanks Caulder lives in Weedy Rough, Arkansashas since the early Thirtiesand loves to tell stories.

Also, despite his small-town upbringing, Shanks went off to the war and got to see quite a bit. In ten wordy but absorbing stories Shanks draws out the essence of this otherwise forgotten corner of Arkansas, in the process telling us as much about himself as anything.

Burgess, U.S. Army TRALINET Ctr., Fort Monroe, Va.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tower, The Zoo, and The Tortoise: A Novel</h2><p><b>Brimming with charm and whimsy, this exquisite novel set in the Tower of London has the transportive qualities and delightful magic of the contemporary classics <i>Chocolat </i>and <i>Am�lie</i>. </b><br><br>Balthazar Jones has lived in the Tower of London with his loving wife, Hebe, and his 120-year-old pet tortoise for the past eight years. That&#x2019;s right, he is a Beefeater (they really do live there). It&#x2019;s no easy job living and working in the tourist attraction in present-day London. <br><br> Among the eccentric characters who call the Tower&#x2019;s maze of ancient buildings and spiral staircases home are the Tower&#x2019;s Rack &amp; Ruin barmaid, Ruby Dore, who just found out she&#x2019;s pregnant; portly Valerie Jennings, who is falling for ticket inspector Arthur Catnip; the lifelong bachelor Reverend Septimus Drew, who secretly pens a series of principled erot�ica; and the philandering Ravenmaster, aiming to avenge the death of one of his insufferable ravens. <br><br> When Balthazar is tasked with setting up an elaborate menagerie within the Tower walls to house the many exotic animals gifted to the Queen, life at the Tower gets all the more interest�ing. Penguins escape, giraffes are stolen, and the Komodo dragon sends innocent people running for their lives. Balthazar is in charge and things are not exactly running smoothly. Then Hebe decides to leave him and his beloved tortoise &#x201c;runs&#x201d; away. <br><br> Filled with the humor and heart that calls to mind the delight�ful novels of Alexander McCall Smith, and the charm and beauty of <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i>, <i>The Tower, the Zoo, and the Tortoise </i>is a magical, wholly origi�nal novel whose irresistible characters will stay with you long after you turn the stunning last page.</p><p><b>JULIA STUART </b>is the author of one previous novel, <i>The Matchmaker of P�rigord</i>. A native of England, she now resides in Bahrain.CHAPTER ONE <br><br>Standing on the battlements in his pajamas, Balthazar Jones looked out across the Thames where Henry III&#x2019;s polar bear had once fished for salmon while tied to a rope. The Beefeater failed to notice the cold that pierced his dressing gown with deadly precision, or the wretched damp that crept round his ankles. Placing his frozen hands on the ancient parapet, he tilted back his head and inhaled the night. There it was again.<br><br>The undeniable aroma had fluttered past his capacious nostrils several hours earlier as he lay sleeping in the Tower of London, his home for the last eight years. Assuming such wonderment was an oasis in his usual gruesome dreams, he scratched at the hairs that covered his chest like freshly fallen ash and descended back into ragged slumber. It wasn&#x2019;t until he rolled onto his side, away from his wife and her souk of competing odours, that he smelt it again. Recognising instantly the exquisite scent of the world&#x2019;s rarest rainfall, the Beefeater sat bolt upright in the darkness, his eyes open wide like those of a baby bird.<br><br>The sudden movement of the mattress caused his wife to undulate for several seconds like a body drifting at sea, and she muttered something incomprehensible. As she turned away from the disturbance, her pillow fell into the gap between the head of the bed and the wall, one of the many irritations of living within circular walls. Balthazar Jones reached down into the dusty no-man&#x2019;s-land and groped around. After carefully retrieving the pillow, he placed it gently next to his wife so as not to disturb her. As he did so, he wondered, as he often had throughout their marriage, how a woman of such beauty, the embers of which still glowed fiercely in her fifty-fifth year, could look just like her father as she slept. For once, he didn&#x2019;t feel the urge to poke her awake in order to rid himself of the harrowing illusion of sharing his bed with his Greek father- in-law, a man whose ferocious looks had led his relatives to refer to him as a good cheese in a dog&#x2019;s skin. Instead, he quickly got out of bed, his heart tight with anticipation. Forgetting his usual gazelle&#x2019;s step at such times, he crossed the room, his bare heels thudding on the emaciated carpet. He peered out, nose and white beard against the pane, which bore the smudges of numerous previous occasions. The ground was still dry. With mounting desperation, he scanned the night sky for the approaching rain clouds responsible for the undeniable aroma. In his panic not to miss the moment for which he had been waiting for more than two years, he hurried past the vast stone fireplace to the other side of the bedroom. His stomach, still bilious from the previous evening&#x2019;s hogget, arrived first.<br><br>Grabbing his dressing gown, its pockets bearing the guilty crumbs of clandestine biscuits, the Beefeater pulled it across his pajamas and, forgetting his tartan slippers, opened the bedroom door. He failed to notice the noise the latch made and the subsequent incomprehensible babble it produced from his wife, a slither of hair skimming her cheek. Fingers sliding down the filthy rope handrail, he descended the corpse- cold spiral stairs clutching in his free hand an Egyptian perfume bottle in which he hoped to capture some of the downfall. Once at the bottom of the steps, he passed his son&#x2019;s bedroom, which he had never brought himself to enter since that terrible, terrible day. Slowly, he shut behind him the door of the Salt Tower, the couple&#x2019;s quarters within the fortress, and congratulated himself on a successful exit. It was at that precise moment that his wife woke up. Hebe Jones ran a hand along the bed sheet that had been a wedding present all those years ago. But it failed to find her husband.<br><br>s balthazar jones had been collecting rain for almost three years, a compulsion that had started shortly after the death of his only child. At first he thought that rain was simply an infuriating part of the job, which, along with the damp from their abominable lodgings, produced in all the Beefeaters a ruthless specimen of fungus that flourished on the backs of their knees. But as the months grated by following the tragedy, he found himself staring at the clouds, frozen in a state of insurmountable grief when he should have been on the lookout for professional pickpockets. As he looked up at the sky, barely able to breathe for the weight of guilt that pressed against his chest, he started to notice a variety in the showers that would invariably soak him during the day. Before long he had identified sixty-four types of rain, all of which he jotted down in a Moleskine notebook he bought specially for the purpose. It wasn&#x2019;t long before he purchased a bulk order of coloured Egyptian perfume bottles, chosen not so much for their beauty but for their ability to conserve their contents. In them he started to collect samples, recording the time, date, and precise variety of rain that had fallen. Much to the annoyance of his wife, he had a cabinet made for them, which he mounted with considerable difficulty on the living room&#x2019;s curved wall. Before long it was full and he ordered two more, which she made him put in the room at the top of the Salt Tower, which she never entered because the chalk graffiti left on the walls by the German U-boat men imprisoned during the Second World War gave her the creeps.<br><br>When his collection had swollen to the satisfying figure of one hundred, the Beefeater promised his wife, who now detested wet weather even more than was natural for a Greek who couldn&#x2019;t swim, he would stop. And for a while it seemed that Balthazar Jones was cured of his habit. But the truth was that England was going through an extraordinary dry patch, and as soon as the rain started to fall again, the Beefeater, who had already been reprimanded by the Chief Yeoman Warder for gazing up at the sky while he should have been answering the tourists&#x2019; tiresome questions, returned to his compulsion.<br><br>Hebe Jones satisfied herself with the thought that eventually her husband would complete his collection and be done with it. But her hopes evaporated when he was sitting on the edge of the bed one night and, after pulling off his damp left sock, revealed with the demented conviction of a man about to prove the existence of dragons that he had only touched the tip of the iceberg. It was then that he had some official writing paper printed with matching envelopes, and set up the St. Heribert of Cologne Club, named after the patron saint of rain, hoping to compare notes with fellow wet weather enthusiasts. He placed adverts in various newspapers around the world, but the only correspondence he ever received was a heavily watermarked letter from an anonymous resident of Mawsynram, in northeastern India, which suffered from one of the world&#x2019;s heaviest rainfalls. &#x201c;Mr Balthazar, You must desist from this utter madness at the most soonest. The only thing worse than a lunatic is a wet one&#x201d; was all that it said.<br><br>But the lack of interest only fuelled his obsession. The Beefeater spent all his spare time writing to meteorologists around the world about his discoveries. He received replies from them all, his fingers, as lithe as a watchmaker&#x2019;s, quiver- ing as he opened them. However, the experts&#x2019; politeness was matched by their disinterest. He changed tack and buried himself in dusty parchments and books at the British Library that were as fragile as his sanity. And with eyes magnified by the strength of his reading glasses, he scoured everything ever written about rain.<br><br>Eventually, Balthazar Jones discovered a variant that, from what he could make out, hadn&#x2019;t fallen since 1892 in Colombo, making it the world&#x2019;s rarest. He read and reread the descriptions of the sudden shower, which, through a catalogue of misfortunes, had resulted in the untimely death of a cow. He became adamant that he would recognise it from its scent even before seeing it. Every day he waited, hoping for it to fall. Obsession eventually loosened his tongue, and one afternoon he heard himself telling his wife of his desperate desire to include it in his collection. With a mixture of incredulity and pity, she gazed up at the man who had never shed a tear over the death of their son, Milo. And when she looked back down at the daffodil bulbs she was planting in a tub on the Salt Tower roof, she wondered yet again what had happened to her husband.<br><br>s standing with his back against the Salt Tower&#x2019;s oak door, the Beefeater glanced around in the darkness to make sure that he wouldn&#x2019;t be spotted by any of the other inhabitants of the fortress. The only movement came from a pair of flesh-coloured tights swinging on a washing line strung up on the roof of the Casemates. These ancient terraced cottages built against the fortress walls housed many of the thirty-five Beefeaters who lived with their families at the Tower. The rest, like Balthazar Jones, had had the misfortune of being allocated one of the monument&#x2019;s twenty-one towers as their home or, worse still, a house on Tower Green, the site of seven beheadings, five of them women.<br><br>Balthazar Jones listened carefully. The only sound emerging through the darkness was a sentry marking his territory, his footfall as precise as a Swiss clock. He sniffed the night again and for a moment he doubted himself. He hesitated, cursing himself for being so foolish as to believe that the moment had finally come. He imagined his wife emitting an aviary of sounds as she dreamt, and decided to return to the warm familiarity of the bed. But just as he was about to retrace his steps, he smelt it again.<br><br>Heading for the battlements, he noticed to his relief that the lights were off at the Rack &amp; Ruin, the Tower&#x2019;s tavern that had been serving the tiny community for two hundred and twenty-seven uninterrupted years, despite a direct hit during the Second World War. He did well to check, for there were occasions when the more vociferous arguments between the Beefeaters took until the early hours to be buried. Not, of course, that they remained that way. For they would often be gleefully dug up again in front of the warring parties by those seeking further entertainment.</p><h2>Constantinople and the West: Essays on the Late Byzantine (Palaeologan) and Italian Renaissances and the Byzantine and Roman Churches</h2><p>Deno John Geanakoplos demonstrates the fusion of Byzantine and Latin cultural and ecelsiastical relations in the Renaissance.</p><p>Deno John Geanakoplos, and internationaly renowned scholar, is the Bradford Durfee Professor Emeritus of Byzantine, Italian Renaissance, and Orthodox Church History at Yale University.

Climate change, globalization, air pollution, and oversanitization of the environment in the early years of life are just a few of the causes that, taken together, have introduced new allergens into our environment that are wreaking havoc and causing needless suffering.<br><br>This &#x201c;new allergen marketplace&#x201d; requires a new allergy solution. According to Dr. Clifford W. Bassett, traditional remedies focus on treating symptoms but leave allergy sufferers vulnerable to continued bouts of misery. Dr. Bassett argues that when we consider a person&#x2019;s genetics, environment, and overall health, we can more effectively identify&#x2014;and take appropriate action to forestall&#x2014;symptoms before they even begin.<br><br>For the first time, Dr. Bassett presents the unique, integrative approach he&#x2019;s used in his Manhattan offices for two decades to vanquish allergy symptoms for countless individuals. In addition to explaining what allergy is (and isn&#x2019;t) and identifying key triggers&#x2014;from nuts to gluten to the nickel commonly used in cell phones&#x2014;Dr. Bassett offers both medical and nonmedical alternatives to treatment, and specific, proactive steps to protect against common allergens. Allergens are here to stay, but with <i>The New Allergy Solution</i>, your life need no longer be ruled and ruined by allergy. <i>The New Allergy Solution</i> strives to enhance your well-being through strategies for a greater sense of control, giving you more freedom to do what you love.</p><p><b>Clifford W. Bassett, M.D., FACAAI, FAAAAI,</b> is the founder and medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York. He serves on the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine and the Weill Cornell Medical College, and is a clinical assistant professor of medicine and otolaryngology at SUNY Health Sciences Center in Brooklyn. One of <i>U.S. News and World Report&#x2019;s </i>Top Doctors, Dr. Bassett is featured regularly on and in local and national media outlets, including <i>CBS This Morning</i>, <i>Today</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, NPR, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>Time</i>. He lives in New York City.<i> </i><p>We are in the midst of an allergy explosion. An estimated 30 percent of Americans, or roughly 100 million people, suffer from allergy and asthma; a Gallup study puts the figure at 50 percent. Globally, allergy affects 20 to 40 percent of the population. The rate in urban environments has increased for the past half century. In the United Kingdom, it&#x2019;s estimated that up to half of all kids suffer from some allergic condition. Once upon a time, you knew a few people with allergies, maybe more than that if your family or neighbors were genetically unlucky enough to have a disposition (more on the genetics of allergy in chapter 2). Now? Probably you know, or know of, five to ten times that number. While many are born wired for their allergic condition, it may be that the environments we now inhabit, both outdoor and in, the behaviors we engage in, the products we use, and the foods we consume have all changed enough in a short time that we are confronted by a genuinely new reality.</p><p>The uptick has occurred not just in one or two kinds of allergy. It spans the spectrum. It&#x2019;s seen in seasonal allergies and allergic respiratory disease, including asthma. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of Americans diagnosed with asthma grew by over 5 million, across all demographics. It&#x2019;s seen in food allergies. The CDC says that food allergy in children rose by half again, between 1997 and 2011. The rate of peanut allergy doubled in the last decade. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology reported a 700 percent rise over the last decade in allergic reactions among European kids.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why is this happening? In many cases, allergy &#x201c;triggers&#x201d;&#x2014;the source of the scourge, exposure to which sets off an immune system reaction ranging from unpleasant to activity-limiting to debilitating to deadly&#x2014;have gotten bigger, badder, and way more prevalent. Ragweed, the central culprit behind fall hay fever for those residing in regions with seasonal climates, is growing faster and bigger in many places, and blooming longer, with more pollen per plant and possibly more potent allergic potential. Combine this with other environmental troubles, such as human-generated air pollutants, and it creates a potential synergistic, amplified impact on your health.<br> &nbsp;<br> Poison ivy today can be found more widely, and it&#x2019;s generally bigger and more potent, too. Even our mix of trees has altered the (allergy) landscape. In 1950, the native American elm, once the most popular &#x201c;street tree&#x201d; in neighborhoods across the United States and other countries, was a modest shedder of insect-transported pollen. But then Dutch elm disease ravaged the elm population, killing off billions&#x2014;yes, billions &#x2014;of these trees in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s. Among their replacements were hardwood species like London plane sycamore and Norway maple, and a greater proportion of male trees, selected largely because they shed less, making it easier to keep streets, sidewalks, and yards clean&#x2014;but they also produced more allergenic, wind-conveyed pollen. Says renowned horticulturist and author Tom Ogren, &#x201c;In many areas today, tree pollen makes up more than 70 percent of the total urban pollen load.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wasps, whose stings can cause allergic reaction ranging from swelling of the skin to hives to potentially deadly anaphylaxis, arrive earlier in the season and stay later. Fire ants, mostly a fixture in the South, seem over the past decade and a half to be moving gradually north and west. The mostly tropical triatoma, commonly called the kissing bug, is spreading northward. Mosquitoes are more prevalent in many areas, and their incubation time in certain regions has grown shorter. Of course, mosquitoes can cause harm far greater than allergic itching and swelling, such as West Nile virus, chikungunya, dengue fever, and the confounding, often devastating Zika, the last three of which are on the rise. Forests are flourishing in the eastern United States&#x2014;good news, right?&#x2014;but that contributes to an increase in the deer population, thus an increase in deer ticks and cases of Lyme disease. In the last fifteen years, the number of annual Lyme cases in Canada has increased from roughly forty to seven hundred; two decades ago, ticks lived and reproduced in two areas in Canada, today in thirteen. The Lone Star tick, whose name bespeaks a southwestern habitat, is spreading north and east; its bite may trigger allergy to red meat, a particularly elusive condition to identify.<br> &nbsp;<br> The reason behind much of what I&#x2019;ve just chronicled is mostly climate change, or increases in extreme weather.&#x201d; But climate change is hardly the only cause of the rise in allergy frequency, severity, and complexity. There are new threats in the air and water; in our food, homes, and offices; and on our bodies&#x2014;our own &#x201c;microenvironments&#x201d;&#x2014;that simply did not exist twenty or so years ago. These factors combine to make diagnosis more complicated. For example, people exposed to ozone plus ragweed allergen likely experience greater illness than those exposed to only one of the two&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s less simple to get at the root, or roots, of what&#x2019;s going on. Our natural balance&#x2014;by which I mean nature itself and our own individual nature&#x2014;has been altered. When that happens, we may become overloaded, and an overreaction by the immune system becomes much more possible. A study by Quest Diagnostics shows that our rate of sensitization to common allergens&#x2014;really, the first step in becoming allergic&#x2014;has increased.<br> &nbsp;<br></p><p>The range of increase in allergy is broad. So are the causes for the surge.</p><i><p><br><br></p></i></p><h2>The Secret Life of the Dyslexic Child</h2><p>For the first time ever-- a look inside your child's secret world <br><br>Dr. Robert Frank, whose own dyslexia didn't stop him from becoming an educator, psychologist, and author, takes you inside the emotions and frustrations of children with learning disorders. <br><br>In <i>Part One</i>, you'll discover what your child never told you about: <br>* How your child's mind works<br>* What your child is feeling<br>* The separate worlds of "Us" and "Them" <br><br>In <i>Part Two</i>, you'll walk in your child's shoes to see for yourself: <br>* What it's like to think like a dyslexic<br>* What it feels like to be different<br>* The emotions that can disrupt your child's progress<br>* How to bridge the gap between your child and others <br><br>In <i>Part Three</i>, you'll get a clear picture of: <br>* The diagnosis of learning disorders<br>* How your reaction affects your child <br><br>In <i>Part Four</i>, you'll receive expert advice to: <br>* Establish goals for your child<br>* Create a game plan for success<br>* Work better with teachers<br>* Boost self-esteem<br>* Find success at school, at home, in life <br><br>Your child isn't dumb.

And how I got to thinking of my bones bleaching up there in the weather, no one knowing where we were or what had happened? Well, it almost did happen one time, and they would have been pretty well scattered, I think.<br><br>"It was getting toward the end of the hunting season. I was coming down Jervis Inlet from the camp. The weather was fine, and I got to thinking that it wouldn't be a bad idea to stop for a hunt. So as I cruised along, I kept an eye out for a likely looking spot, and pretty soon I saw just what I was looking for. There was a nice little draw going up into the mountains, and a bit farther on there was another one almost its twin. I saw that I could go up one, cross over and come down the other one. It was pretty steep, but didn't look as though it would be too hard to cross over the hump between them and get back to the boat. If I got a deer it would be an easy downhill drag to the beach. So I ran out the anchor, put a shoreline on a tree and away I went."<br><br>Father loved to explore, to go where he hadn't been before. Hunting was often just an excuse to see new country. This day was certainly one of those times. He had no need to climb a mountain to get deer. There were plenty of those to be had on much easier ground, and closer to home.<br><br>He climbed up beside the little creek that runs down every mountain valley, however small. No matter how similar they seem from a distance, they are always different and always interesting, if your mind inclines that way.<br><br>He saw lots of fresh tracks as he went along, but there was quite a bit of undergrowth and he never managed to get a look at a deer. The trees became sparse, and the ground more steep and rocky. It was time to cross over into the next valley.<br><br>He had spent more time than he should have and he knew that it would be wiser to go back down to the boat over familiar ground, but that was just what he didn't want to do. He decided to chance it. Up and over the ridge he went, down into the upper reaches of an almost identical valley. Here though, he felt he had more chance of getting a deer, for what wind there was, blew up the hill toward him. He was hunting now, moving slowly, alertly. But this takes time, and the afternoon was waning.<br><br>Then he came to a difficult spot. Here the creek streamed over a fifty foot drop, and the rocks were slick with moss and unclimbable. It took him almost an hour to pick his way up, across and down, with several false starts. Far below, the water of the inlet shone grey in the afternoon light. The sun had gone behind the mountains, for there is not much afternoon in those steep valleys in late fall.<br><br>He considered what to do. He would have liked to cross back over to the other valley. He knew the ground and would have no trouble going down it in the dark. But the ridge was steep here and might prove difficult. He didn't care for the thought of being halfway down the other side when night came. He could go farther down the valley he was in, to where the trees grew more thickly, make a fire and bed down for the night. But it was long since he had eaten, and the prospect of hot food and a warm bunk on his boat was hard to put out of his mind. He recalled that the lower part of the dividing ridge was timbered and hadn't seemed to be a difficult climb. There was sure to be a deer trail leading from one valley to the next. He decided to try it. As he got nearer the water he began to angle up onto the ridge. It was now dusk, and in the shadows it was becoming too dark to see small objects.<br><br>"Several times I almost stopped and built a fire," he said, "but each time the thought of that pot of hot stew on the stove drew me to it like a magnet. A man has to be crazy to do a thing like that, climbing over the rocks on a strange mountain in the dark. But then, being young is much like being crazy!"<br><br>So he kept going, and he got lucky. At least that's the way he put it. But I think that at a high enough level, skill can seem like good luck. At any rate, he found a distinct deer trail leading in the right direction. And just in time. Once started, full dark comes very quickly in the mountains. In a few more minutes he could see only a few feet in front of him.<br><br>"But," he said, "you don't need to see very much to follow a good deer trail. It takes the natural course and you can feel your way along it with your feet." (Well, some people might, and if anyone could, it was him.) "And," he said, "it was a good trail. Must have connected more than just those two valleys. Anyway, I was making pretty good time considering the circumstances. It wasn't completely dark. There were a few stars showing between the clouds, but there was no moon. You could tell a branch was there just before it hit you in the face.<br><br>"I'd reached the top of the ridge. There was a bit of flat ground, fairly clear of brush, but there were a lot of boulders scattered about, some of them the size of a small house. The trail led around and between them. It was an eerie sort of a place, and something about it began to get to me. In those days the woods were like home to me, but it didn't feel like home there.<br><br>"Two or three times in as many minutes, I stopped and listened. There wasn't a sound. I took in a deep breath. There was something about the air I didn't like. I took a few more steps. There still wasn't a sound, but I knew I wasn't alone. I jacked a shell into the gun and swung around. I smelled a rank smell and something loomed up over me, and I fired point-blank from the hip. The muzzle flash lit up a huge black shape reaching for me. Then, of course, I couldn't see much of anything for a few seconds. I jumped back and tripped over a blueberry bush while trying to get another shell into the chamber. Something grunted and fell heavily to the ground, making quite a bit of noise. By that time I had my back to a boulder and another round ready. I stayed still as death. There was a light air blowing across in front of me, so I knew whatever was out there couldn't scent me. I heard a few scuffling sounds and the occasional moan. I had a few matches. What I would have given for a fire! But the thing might just be waiting to see where I was, and anyway, starting a fire in the dark with nothing around but blueberry brush and hemlock, when it has been raining steadily for days, was something I wouldn't even try. Especially with some big creature I might have only wounded just a few feet away. And, it could have relatives nearby.<br><br>"So I just sat there. All night. Listening. Thinking of all the stories I'd heard since I was a kid about the monsters that live in the mountains. I don't think a night was ever that long before or since. The moans stopped after a while. I didn't know whether it had died, or recovered and was watching me, and I wasn't about to go over there and find out. A match is a poor thing to shoot by.<br><br>"I sat there for twelve hours, I figure, with the gun in front of me and my finger on the trigger, and all that time I imagined I heard noises all around me, of things sneaking up on me. It's wonderful what the imagination can do with the sound a mouse makes scuffling around in the leaves. I'll never forget that night!<br><br>"Daylight came, finally. I had just about given up on it. Never was that first faint light so welcome. The birds tell you first; you know how you hear a little chirp or two? Pretty soon you realize it isn't quite as dark as it was.<br><br>"When I could see about ten feet, I got up and stretched. Then I walked carefully over to where I figured the thing was. I don't know what I expected to see. Maybe one of those big hairy people the Indians say live in the mountains. Certainly that's what I should say it was to make a good story out of it. But I'm afraid it wasn't. I never did come across one of those, though I believe the Indians are telling the truth about them. But what it was was strange enough, though I didn't realize it at first.<br><br>"What I saw was just a big black bear lying dead on the trail. I'd been perfectly safe. My shot had broken its back. I was puzzled. Black bears don't go around hunting people. It was in good shape. Not fat, but good, shiny fur. Its eyes were closed, which was odd. Then I saw that they weren't closed. It had no eyes! At least if they were there, they were covered with a thick layer of unbroken skin. It had been born blind. How had it lived? Of course bears don't have very good sight at the best of times, but it's not as bad as some people make out. It was light enough now to see, and I walked around a bit. I saw bones. Deer bones mostly, but there was part of a bear skull. No human bones that I could see, though I'd almost left mine there. I found his den between two boulders half buried in the hillside. He had lived there for quite a while catching what came by, whatever it was-never knowing night from day. It gave me the shivers thinking of that thing waiting there listening to me coming along, and sneaking up behind me in the dark. It must have known every rock, every twig and bush on the whole flat. I often wonder how it learned what it knew. How to be silent. How it could be so silent! A deer can just about hear grass growing. How could it catch a deer? But there were a lot of deer bones. Makes you wonder, doesn't it?"<br><br>He skinned out the head and brought it back and tanned it. I can remember seeing it when I was very young. That it had no eyes didn't impress me much at that time. My mother didn't like it. When I was old enough to be interested, it had been thrown out, or lost.</p><h2>The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</h2><p>The Franklin Library leather bound with gilt pages, gold lettering and a hub spine.

Here we find all of Walcott's essential themes, from grappling with the Caribbean's colonial legacy to his conflicted love of home and of Western literary tradition; from the wisdom-making pain of time and mortality to the strange wonder of love, the natural world, and what it means to be human. We see his lifelong labor at poetic crafts, his broadening of the possibilities of rhyme and meter, stanza forms, language, and metaphor. Edited and with an introduction by the Jamaican poet and critic Edward Baugh, this volume is a perfect representation of Walcott's breadth of work, spanning almost half a century.</p></p><p><b>Derek Walcott (1930-2017)</b> was born in St. Lucia, the West Indies, in 1930. His <i>Collected Poems: 1948-1984</i> was published in 1986, and his subsequent works include a book-length poem, <i>Omeros </i>(1990); a collection of verse, <i>The Bounty</i> (1997); and, in an edition illustrated with his own paintings, the long poem <i>Tiepolo's Hound</i> (2000). His numerous plays include <i>The Haitian Trilogy</i> (2001) and <i>Walker and The Ghost Dance</i> (2002). Walcott received the Queen's Medal for Poetry in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.This career-spannning retrospective, culled from nearly 50 years of work, will go a long way toward reminding readers of the breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Walcott's achievement. Though he is perhaps best known for his modern epic, <i>Omeros</i>, which tells a Homeric tale set in St. Lucia, Walcott is a fine lyric poet as well, writing in traditional forms and meters as well as in powerful free verse. Alongside the epic tone that he brought into modern verse&#x2014;"I sing of Achille, Afolabe's son,/ who never ascended in an elevator"&#x2014;is lustful writing about a woman humming Bob Marley on a bus, a casual description of being mugged in Greenwich Village or a painter's-eye view of a fish. The political Walcott is also here; observing a crowd listening to a politician, he writes, "Who will name this silence/ respect? Those forced, hoarse hosannas/ awe?" The lyric Walcott is well represented, but the long poems&#x2014;which are necessarily excerpted&#x2014;prove more problematic. At best, the editor can hope that readers, hooked by one of these narrative poems, will be compelled to seek out the complete version. Nonetheless, this book represents a milestone in the career of a major writer. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Willimon return with spirited offensive strategies for feisty resident aliens. A resident alien knows who the enemy is, and here is a guide to the Christian initiation, practice, and discipline that is required for a people at war with the world. </p> <p>Some Christian liberals think that resident aliens are sectarian, and that they wish to withdraw from engagement with the world. God forbid! The book is thus full of stories of resident aliens who have been baptized, trained, and conditioned -- like Marines in boot camp -- to be new citizens and find a new home in the distinctly Christian community. </p> <p>Some Christian conservatives want a "to do" list that lays out the program for becoming a congregation or small group of resident aliens. Or perhaps they want a list of beliefs that might be defended. You won't find that here, for these desires are what ails the disestablished church. A list of options and choices, or an elective program for "wannabe" resident aliens, is an accommodation to the false god of freedom. Resident aliens are imitated and understood by telling their stories, by enfleshing their practices in the narrative that becomes part of the unfolding Christian story.</p></p><p>Stanley Hauerwas is the Gilbert T.

In his long teaching career, Atwood has found that most students know virtually nothing about America&#39;s involvement in the wars of the 20th century, let alone those prior to World War I. War and Empire aims to correct this, clearly and persuasively explaining US actions in every major war since the declaration of independence. The book shows that, far from being dragged reluctantly into foreign entanglements, America&#39;s leaders have always picked its battles in order to increase their influence and power, with little regard for the American soldiers and &#39;enemy&#39; civilians killed or made to suffer in the process. This book is an eye-opening introduction to the American way of life for undergraduate students of American history, politics and international relations.</p><p><p><b>Paul Atwood</b> is a senior lecturer in the American studies department and research associate in the William Joiner Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences, both at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

Unlike the Anglo-Americans, who widely embraced middle-class ideals and values, the French--even the most affluent and conservative--have always rejected and maligned bourgeois values and identity. </p><p> In this new approach to the old question of the bourgeoisie, Sarah Maza focuses on the crucial period before, during, and after the French Revolution, and offers a provocative answer: the French bourgeoisie has never existed. Despite the large numbers of respectable middling town-dwellers, no group identified themselves as bourgeois. Drawing on political and economic theory and history, personal and polemical writings, and works of fiction, Maza argues that the bourgeoisie was never the social norm. In fact, it functioned as a critical counter-norm, an imagined and threatening embodiment of materialism, self-interest, commercialism, and mass culture, which defined all that the French rejected. </p><p> A challenge to conventional wisdom about modern French history, this book poses broader questions about the role of anti-bourgeois sentiment in French culture, by suggesting parallels between the figures of the bourgeois, the Jew, and the American in the French social imaginary. It is a brilliant and timely foray into our beliefs and fantasies about the social world and our definition of a social class. </p></p><p><b>Sarah Maza</b> is Jane Long Professor of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University.This is a bold work on a big topic, based on wide erudition and deep reflection. Maza&#39;s consistent focus on what she calls &#34;the social imaginary&#34; enables her to stride with admirable briskness through the tangled landscape of this much studied and highly controversial era of French history. While not everyone will be convinced by Maza&#39;s claim that the French bourgeoisie did not exist, this book will transform the way we think about the problem. (William H.

Then she and her son Alan, who was born on the estate and is now a professor of social anthropology, delve into the history of the leaf that over thousands of years became "the world's favorite drink," emphasizing the links between tea and political, cultural, social and economic events in China, Japan, India and England, where the British obsession with that "nice cup of tea" fueled the rapid growth of the British Empire. They also expound on the health benefits of tea, listing its many medicinal properties and contending that when tea was first introduced into China, Japan and England, it led to a decline in mortality rates because boiling the water to make it kills harmful bacteria. The story comes full circle in the final chapters, which concentrate on the hardships of the "coolies" who labored to harvest and process tea under the control of their rapacious British overlords. Although the book is more scholarly and less provocative than Roy Moxham's recent indictment of the British tea industry, Tea: A History of Addiction, Exploitation, and Empire, it presents an equally fascinating picture of tea's impact on the lives of millions of people around the world.

Frank Lloyd Wright and Lewis Mumford, two pivotal figures in 20th-century American architecture and urbanism, were both passionate writers, keenly aware of world events. Their 150 letters from 1926--1958 covered a wide range of topics, including Wright's position in the history of American architecture and contemporary practice, their friends and rivals, the invention and spread of the International Style, and political events in Europe and the US. A fallout over isolationist politics in the early 1940s led to a 10-year gap in their exchange, and when it resumed, the two were on an entirely different footing: Wright, the elder dean of American architecture at the height of his creative powers, and Mumford, an established critic in late middle age deeply committed to rebuilding a humanist outlook in the aftermath of World War II. Frank Lloyd Wright &amp; Lewis Mumford offers an intimate look inside the minds and hearts of these two cultural giants, deepening our understanding of the men and the society they helped shape.</p><p>Robert Wojtowicz is the literary executor of the Lewis Mumford estate and an associate professor of art history at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.The meeting of two great 20th-century architectural minds is recorded in Frank Lloyd Wright &amp; Lewis Mumford: Thirty Years of Correspondence, edited by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Archives Director at the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, and Robert Wojtowicz, chair of the Art Department at Old Dominion University. Wright first wrote to Mumford in 1926, when he was in his 50s and already renowned, and Mumford was in his 30s and making his name in cultural criticism. Mumford, who focused much of his writing on architecture and urban planning, greatly admired Wright's work as "the exemplar of organic design, built in accordance with the rhythms of modern life"; the two men shared ideas and interests, though Mumford resisted getting too intimate in order to preserve his critical integrity. Their friendship weathered political, aesthetic and personal disagreements (including a 10-year rift regarding U.S. intervention in WWII), but up until Wright's death in 1959 they maintained fondness and admiration for one another.

She falls in love with the place; buys a house; ultimately buys an island because it is the view from her house and because she wants to save it from development. With the help of none other than the real-life assistant to the legendary vet James Herriot, she finds herself the owner of a flock of quasi-wild sheep on Blue Island, Nova Scotia. So begins Anne Barclay Priest's wonderful tale of her life between New York and Nova Scotia that extends over the next several decades. Her hilarious and heart-warming stories populated with evocative local characters and unforgettable animal friends recount the trials and tribulations of this urban actress/rural farmer life. It's the story of a woman who has dared to live the kind of independent and self-directed life that the rest of us only dream about.</p><p>Anne Barclay Priest, now in her late 70s, continues to raise sheep on her farm in New York State. After graduating from Radcliffe College in 1949, Anne became a foreign correspondent covering much of the post-war work of the United Nations. She later got involved with the theater in Massachusetts and had her professional debut in 1968. She moved to New York City in 1978 and now lives in Greenville, NY.Priest, an actor turned shepherd, ambles through the story of her part-time renunciation of Cape Cod summering and New York City loft living to settle in remote, idyllic Nova Scotia in the 1970s&#x2014;a change that brought "richness and beauty" to her life. Prompted by nostalgia for her cozy childhood home, she makes a fateful series of impulse purchases in Nova Scotia: a 200-year-old house and then an entire island. A craggy wilderness of alders and brambles, Blue Island wears a menacing air, reflected in topographic titles like the gulch named Hell Hole. Priest, undaunted, plunges deeper into the pastoral archetype to populate the island with a flock of sheep, learning the finer points of shearing and worming as she rears them for the butcher. She warms to the frigid clime by virtue of gruff but friendly neighbors on nearby islands, who pitch in to school her in the agrarian ways. Priest's humor appears in flashes, as when she unleashes an amorous ram upon her flock. But her narrative, lacking focus, too often meanders into more ponderous city affairs, distracting readers from immersing themselves in island life. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since the early 1970s, Gyatrul Rinpoche has taught thousands of students in North America, where he has established several centers for the study and practice of Tibetan Buddhism.

Next Calypso sails halfway around the world to the island of Guadalupe, off Baja California, where rare elephant seals gather during the mating season. The crew spends a period of time among these shy animals, whose long, trunklike noses give them their name, observing their living habits and finding that behind their forbidding exteriors they are endowed with originality.

During its original run in New York, Chicago, and Boston from mid-February to mid-May of 1913 and in the subsequent scholarship on the topic, most attention has centered on the avant-garde European artists, particularly Marcel Duchamp, Constantin Brancusi, and Henri Matisse, even though art by Americans comprised two-thirds of the works on view in this legendary show. <em>The New Spirit</em> is the first exhibit and catalogue to focus primarily on the American art in the Armory Show. While works by such renowned artists as Edward Hopper, Robert Henri, John Marin, Charles Sheeler, and George Bellows are included, The New Spirit highlights paintings, sculpture, watercolors, and prints by artists like Leon Kroll, Middleton Manigault, D.

Classic novels such as<i> Revolutionary Road</i> and <i>The Easter Parade</i> are incomparable chronicles of the quiet and not-so-quiet desperation of the American middle-class. Lonely housewives, addled businessmen, desperate career-girls and fearful boys and soldiers, Yates&#x2019;s America was a panorama of high living, self-doubt and self-deception. And in the tradition of other great realistic writers of his time (Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Cheever and Updike), Yates&#x2019;s fictional world mirrored his own. A manic-depressive alcoholic and unapologetic gentleman, his life was a hornets&#x2019; nest of childhood ghosts, the horrors of war, money woes, and ebullient cocktailed evenings in New York, Hollywood, and the Riviera.<br><br><i>A Tragic Honesty </i>is a masterful evocation of a man who in many ways embodied the struggles of the Great American Writer in the latter half of the twentieth century. Fame and reward followed by heartbreak and obscurity, Richard Yates here stands for what the writer must sacrifice for his craft, the devil&#x2019;s bargain of artistry for happiness, praise for sanity.<br></p><p>Richard Yates worked his way down from the top. His brilliantly pitiless 1961 classic about exploded '50s suburban dreams, <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, made him a peer of Cheever and Updike (though Natalie Wood broke his heart by scuttling the movie version). William Styron got him a gig writing civil rights speeches for Bobby Kennedy: "He used RFK s a ventriloquist's dummy," says Kurt Vonnegut, who, like Yates's future employer, David (<i>NYPD Blue</i>) Milch, met him at the celebrated Iowa writing program. Yates's dark gift casts a colossal shadow enriching our culture: he was a profound influence on Richard Ford, Mary Robison, Ann Beattie, and the Minimalist literary movement. He also inspired the "Alton Benes" <i>Seinfeld</i> episode (his daughter, who apparently shares her dad's mordant wit, helped inspire the character Elaine). Blake Bailey soberly records Yates's rather stylishly bleak spiral from fame into drunkenness and self-imposed obscurity, despite the loyalty of his famous friends. He drunkenly set fire to his beard, succumbed to writer's block and delusions that he'd killed JFK, heedlessly and needlessly alienated even people he admired. But one reason he died poor, with the manuscript of his RFK novel, <i>Uncertain Times</i> in his freezer, was precisely his gift: an honesty that ranks with the greatest of tragedians. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Blake Bailey is the author of a previous book, <i>The Sixties</i>, and has written for a number of magazines, newspapers, and scholarly publications. He lives in Waldo, Florida, with his wife Mary.<br></p><h2>Season&#39;s Greetings</h2><p>Comedy / Casting: 5m, 4f / Scenery: Combined Interior<p> Half a dozen friends and relatives are celebrating Christmas with Neville and Belinda.

Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language."

With 19 chapters, this oversize hardcover includes a variety of stories, from the early tales of Gaea and the Titans to individual tales of gods readers encounter in the "Percy Jackson" series (Hyperion), such as Ares, Apollo, and Dionysus. Percy's irreverent voice is evident from titles such as "Hera Gets a Little Cuckoo," "Zeus Kills Everyone," and "Artemis Unleashes the Death Pig," and the stories are told in his voice with his distinctive perspective ("Another guy who got a special punishment was Sisyphus. With a name like Sissy-Fuss you have to figure the guy had issues..."). The format and illustrations are fairly traditional, considering the tone, featuring painterly depictions of the gods and their world. While these are actual tales of Greek mythology, Percy's take adds more color than would be helpful for those working on research projects or reports. The stories do make for fun reading, however, and might work as starting points for schoolwork. This original and wildly entertaining spin on Greek mythology is bound to be popular among fans of the series.&#x2014;Heather Talty, formerly at Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, New York City</p><h2>On Your Toes: A Ballet ABC</h2><p><p>A Ballet Company dances ... across the pages of this sparkling picture book, inviting you behind the scenes and illuminating ballet terms from A to Z.</p><p>A Ballet Company dances ... for the very youngest of dancers as well as for ballet fans of all ages.</p></p><p><p>Many children dream of becoming dancers, musicians, actors, and artists, but few have the opportunity, the skill, and the determination to live out those dreams. Rachel Isadora is the exception. When she was young, she wanted to be a ballerina--and she became one. And now she has firmly established herself in a second career as an artist with an impressive string of picture books, including <em>Ben's Trumpet</em>, a Caldecott Honor Book.</p><p>Born and raised in New York City, Rachel studied at the School of American Ballet (associated with the New York City Ballet) as a Ford Foundation scholarship student. She danced with the Boston Ballet until a foot injury forced her to consider another career: book illustration. "I had always drawn for my own entertainment," says Rachel, "but I'd never had any instruction, and I wasn't sure how to proceed. So I just took a collection of sketches-odds and ends on bits of paper-to the first editor who would see me. She suggested I do a book about what I knew best." The result was <em>Max</em>, published in 1976 and named an ALA Notable Book.</p><p>Since Max, Rachel has written and illustrated many other books, and has illustrated three books by her editor, Elizabeth Shub. When Rachel begins a new book, she first imagines the story through the pictures. I 'see' each illustration separately," she says. "I write a description of what I envision on each page; then I go over it with my editor and make revisions. Next I do the actual drawing, and finally I write the text."</p><p>Rachel Isadora lives in New York City with her two children. When she is not busy with her family, she spends most of her spare time drawing. "Work like this is a dancer's fantasy," she says. "Because ballet is so demanding, dancers' stage careers are short. They can only dream of going on and on forever. With art, I can go on and on, and for me it's the only work that compares in intensity and joy."</p>PreS-Gr. 1. A dancer with the Boston Ballet before she turned to writing and illustration, Isadora offers a captivating alphabet book full of big, beautiful pictures of young dancers in the studio and onstage. From <i>arabesque</i> to <i>zipper,</i> the alphabet rolls along with a variety of terms closely or loosely related to ballet. Each word or phrase is illustrated with a large pastel picture. <i>Backstage</i> shows four girls waiting in the wings, peering at the dancers onstage; <i>jump</i> features three boys bouncing into the air; <i>makeup</i> shows a costumed girl as she stares into a mirror at her heavily made-up face. The book ends with a helpful two-page glossary including pronunciations of unfamiliar words and commentary on the terms and their visual interpretations. Ballet fans may pick up some information here, but they will return to the book mainly to look again at the richly colored, dynamic illustrations of the dancers. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It explores many of the country&#39;s most famous and best-loved castles, as well as some little-known national treasures. The story begins in the 11th century, when castles were introduced to Britain, and ends in the 17th century, when they were largely abandoned. It is, in some respects, an epic tale, driven by characters like William the Conqueror, &#34;Bad&#34; King John and Edward I, who, by building and besieging castles, shaped the fate of the nation. At the same time, however, it is a more homely story, about the adventures, struggles and ambitions of lesser-known individuals, and how every aspect of their lives was wrapped up in the castles they built. As Marc Morris shows, there is more to castles than drawbridges and battlements, portcullises and arrow-loops. Be it ever so grand or ever so humble, a castle is first and foremost a home. It may look tough and defensible on the outside, but on the inside, a castle is all about luxury and creature comforts. Inside real castles, we do no necessarily find cannons and suits of armour, but we do discover great halls, huge kitchens, private chambers and chapels - all rooms which were once luxurious and lavish, and which made these buildings perfect residences for their owners. To understand castles - who built them, who lived in them, and why - is to understand the forces that shaped medieval Britain.</p><p>Beginning in the 11th century, when castles were first introduced to Britain, and ending in the 17th century, when they were largely abandoned, <b>Castle</b> charts an epic history, driven by figures like William the Conqueror, who, by building and besieging castles, shaped the fate of the nation.

As historian Marc Morris shows us, there is more to castles than drawbridges and battlements. Grand or humble, a castle is first and foremost a home.

Drawing upon course work, papers and exams, this book brings to life the experience and curriculum associated with earning a master of arts in religion from Yale Divinity School. Accentuated by anecdotes from the classroom and personal correspondence, the text is laced with observations on pedagogy and the differences between teachers, professors and scholars. Along the way, sacred scripture, the timelessness of religious metaphors, and the power of ideas to resonate across cultures and centuries come into play. Unsatisfied by the historical-critical approach to Biblical studies, the author searches for professors and methods that speak to her own sensibility. By a stroke of luck, she happens upon Aristotle&#x2019;s Poetics and her faith is turned upside down. In the end, Trang offers a synthesis of her studies by presenting a chart highlighting the features of "Team A" (the Roman Catholic Church) and "Team 1" (Protestant Christianity). She suggests that Team A is theocentric and works with finite letters that create words to produce sentences and tell stories. The "A" team is materialistic, pays attention to matter and the senses, honors ancestors, and is motivated by eros while focusing on lover and children. "Team 1", on the other hand is anthropocentric, works with infinite integers that create equations and produce quotients. Team "1" is idealistic, pays attention to form, doesn't seem interested in ancestors and is motivated by agape while focusing on neighbors and pets. Trang concludes that both teams are valid and necessary, similar to Mary and Martha. As someone who loves listening to stories, she naturally falls in line with Team A but is grateful that Team 1 is there to do the accounting. Elizabeth Carroll Trang has a master&#x2019;s degree in religion and a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in Chinese language and literature. Her interests include the fourth commandment (honor your father and mother), filial piety, ancestors, desire, the sense of touch, intuition, and the Holy Eucharist. She and her husband have two children and live in Washington, DC.</p><p>Trang&#x2019;s debut memoir relates her four years at Yale Divinity School, where she examined the sacraments, sacrifice and sex within the tenets of Christianity. <br><br>Writing from &#x201c;the perspective of someone sitting in the classroom,&#x201d; Trang intends her story for not only religious scholars and pastors behind the pulpit, but for lay and nonreligious readers as well. With effortless grace and delicious humor, the book traces the author&#x2019;s course load and the exchanges she has with her professors, whom she affectionately renames after desserts&#x2014;Professors PoundCake, BakedAlaska, GingerSnap, RhubarbCrumble, etc. But Trang is ever serious and respectful in her desire &#x201c;to learn to think..., to pray..., to live like these people.&#x201d; Trang enters Yale with big questions about the efficacy of a priest committing himself to a life of celibacy and the outrageousness of a sacrament where a priest stands for Christ at the altar and says, &#x201c;This is my body..., This is my blood....&#x201d; And then there is the &#x201c;indwelling of the Holy Spirit problem,&#x201d; a space of being &#x201c;in-between&#x201d; the &#x201c;already and the not yet&#x201d;&#x2014;not unlike that of the sexual act and the bearing of a child. As Trang enthusiastically yet steadily works her way through the catechism of the Catholic Church, Holy Scripture and Aristotle&#x2019;s Poetics under the guidance of Professors SnickerDoodle, PeachCobbler, KeyLimePie and others, her knowledge organically coalesces, unravels, reassembles, expands and contracts. Struggling with the tedious, vast and complex puzzle of faith and often finding God dwelling in her fellow humans, Trang&#x2019;s spirit never wavers while investigating the curiosities and delights of her faith. <br><br>A refreshingly rebellious exploration of Christianity that is well-written, thoughtful and totally unpretentious</p><h2>Finding the Dream (Dream Trilogy, Book 3)</h2><p>Laura Templeton found out the hard way that nothing in life is guaranteed.

This nostalgic journey through the career of a rock-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-roll legend chronicles every album and each stage of Springsteen&#x2019;s career.

He is the acclaimed director of such classic films as <b>Mean Streets</b>, <b>Taxi Driver</b>, <b>Raging Bull</b>, and <b>Goodfellas</b>.</p>Thirty years after Springsteen's first album, numerous books have been published about his rise from Bob Dylan-style acoustic folkie to the raging rocker of Born in the U.S.A. and the working-class hero of The Ghost of Tom Joad. But hardcore Springsteen fans-this volume's clear target audience-can't seem to read enough about their hero, and this collection's many fascinating observations should deeply satisfy them. Sawyers (Celtic Music: A Complete Guide) collects a wide range of articles about Springsteen from all stages of his career to show "his enormous facility for growth." Some of the best of these are groundbreaking essays from the 1970s by Peter Knobler of Crawdaddy and the late Lester Bangs of Creem, as well as Time and Newsweek's simultaneous 1975 cover stories after the release of Springsteen's Born to Run. What these articles offer are specific musical descriptions of Springsteen's ability, as noted by Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone, to encapsulate "20 years of rock &amp; roll tradition." However, the bulk of the essays are solely concerned with Springsteen's progression in his lyrics from early descriptions of characters of the "street and boardwalk subcultures" in his native New Jersey to later looks at those characters' lost hopes and dreams. As Sawyers notes in her engaging introduction, Springsteen undertakes "an ongoing exploration, via popular song, of the very heart of the American psyche." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Plants, flowers, and trees were Marie-Antoinette&#x2019;s passion; she transformed the Petit Trianon&#x2019;s gardens into an enchanted escape from the oppressive shackles of Versailles. Based on archival documents, this book meanders through Marie-Antoinette&#x2019;s estate as the queen herself would have walked it: traversing hyacinths, buttercups, and anemones in the French Gardens, via winding paths in the Anglo-Chinese Gardens, through the conifers of the Belvedere Gardens&#x2014;where fabulous nocturnal parties were hosted&#x2014;past the entrancing aromas of the shrubs surrounding the Temple of Love, to the wildflowers of the Garden of Solitude. This fascinating reconstruction includes descriptions of the cosmetic and medicinal uses of the garden&#x2019;s plants, anecdotes from the royal court, and watercolors of the herbarium.</p><p>Historian and perfume specialist �lisabeth de Feydeau has published books on perfume.

Without a formal accusation or trial, the onetime national hero was imprisoned on Buru for eleven years.

That year, however, as Indonesia embarked on a period of intense social unrest, Pramoedya and tens of thousands of others were detained and eventually exiled to the remote island of Buru. Imprisoned on Buru for eleven years without trial or formal accusation, Pramoedya and his fellow prisoners were forced to clear dense tracts of jungle, build camps, and forage for food. They died by the hundreds of starvation, brutality, and disease. Whether he is narrating the story of a fellow prisoner, remembering the dead and the missing, discussing what is means to be a citizen, or giving advise to his children in letters he knew they would never receive, Pramoedya&#39;s courage, integrity, and commitment to social justice are in powerful evidence.Pramoedya Ananta Toer was born on the island of Java in 1925. The author of thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, including the novels of the <i>Buru Quartet</i> (<i>This Earth of Mankind</i>, <i>Child of All Nations</i>, <i>Footsteps</i>, and <i>House of Glass</i>), he is the recipient of the PEN Freedom-to-Write Award and the Ramon Magsaysay Award.

In 1944, he and his fellow SOE officer Billy Moss, aided by local partisans, kidnapped the German commander of Crete, General Heinrich Kreipe, and spirited him away to captivity in Egypt. This gripping first-hand account, published after his death, includes Fermor&#39;s own intelligence reports, sent from caves deep within the island.</p><p>Patrick Leigh Fermor (1915-2011) was the greatest travel writer of our generation.

He was awarded the DSO and OBE and was once described by the BBC as &#39;a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene&#39;. Towards the end of his life he wrote the first two books about his early trans-European odyssey, A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water.

Reprint.</p><p>Dennis L. McKiernan is the author of many novels, most of them set in the world of Mithgar. He is one of the most prolific and enduring writers of fantasy today.*Starred Review* One chill autumn eve, a handsome young knight rides into the life and the heart of Liaze, princess of the Autumnwood, who has long awaited her true love. Unfortunately, he is badly wounded and pursued by trolls. Liaze quickly dispatches the most immediate trolls--so gratifying to see a princess really fight her own battles--hauls the unconscious knight back on his war horse, hops on behind him, and tears off toward home. Luc--the knight--heals and falls in love but, having been raised by a woodsman, hasn't a clue who he really is. Judging from his courtly manners and battle training, Liaze suspects there's more to him, and when a vile witch kidnaps him and places him, under a spell, atop a glass mountain, she aims to get him back, despite such major setbacks as having no trail to follow. The Fates, who seem to have a soft spot in their hearts for Liaze's family, get involved but can offer aid only in the form of riddles. Meanwhile, time is running out so very, very quickly. No one beats McKiernan at the traditionally styled adult fairy tale, with something for everyone: beautiful princess oblivious to all states of personal dishabille, handsome prince, impossible challenges, despicably evil creatures, and romance, romance, romance! Quite simply enchanting. <i>Paula Luedtke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The man, if he existed at all, lived even earlier. In this definitive work, Professor Sir James Holt, one of Britain&#x2019;s premier historians and author of the standard work on the Magna Carta, unravels pure invention from real possibility and offers the results of some thirty years of research.<br><br> He assesses the evidence for the historical Robin Hood and finds that the tale originated with the yeomen and hangers-on of the households of noblemen and gentry in the later Middle Ages. Parts of the story that we now take for granted&#x2015;Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, Robin as robber of the rich and giver to the poor, even Sherwood Forest&#x2015;played little or no part in the original tales, and were added as the centuries passed and the legends grew.<br><br> The legend of Robin Hood has enthralled people from the first ballads to contemporary movies.

Now each region is on its own in a chaotic political environment, sometimes without diplomatic recognition from neighbors, much less the international community. Abkhazia, an unrecognized country on the Black Sea, was once the natural pearl of the empire, where bellicose generals and productive factory managers came to relax. The spacecraft crash zones between Russia and Kazakhstan reveal a Soviet-inflected version of the entrepreneurial spirit. In Transdniester, a breakaway region of Moldova that survives by functioning as a giant black market for illicit traffic in all manner of goods, from leftover Soviet munitions to bootlegged booze, Bendiksen was expelled on the grounds that he was a &#34;protagonist in an international spy ring.&#34; These 62 hauntingly beautiful and often arresting color photographs unsentimentally reveal the often grim circumstances in these half-forgotten regions, uniformly poor and polluted, and often politically unstable. We may not hear much about them today, but we will certainly hear more as the fall of the Iron Curtain continues to reverberate throughout the region.</p><p>"No matter how brilliant, Bendiksen's captionless photographs--stark streetscapes, desolate landscapes, claustrophobic interiors--can't begin to describe the bloody history or current collapse of these self-styled sovereign states, but his brief introductions to each splinter republic do the trick succinctly and with wit." -- Vince Aletti --Photograph Magazine<br><br>"From Trans-Dniester, a region of the Republic of Moldova whose independence remains an issue of contention, to the Jewish Autonomous Region of Birobidzhan in Russia's far eastern federal district at China's border, the Norwegian-born lensman captures people in the midst of forging a new identity from a turbulent past and the unsure future that awaits." -- Paul Moakley --Newsweek<br><br>Jonas Bendiken's Satellites is, by all accounts, a classic piece of photojournalism that is brought together in a totally, modern package. It reminds us that, despite the sophistication of modern technology, which creates spacecraft looking to the heavens for answers, we should be looking for answers here, on Earth." -- Michael Grieve --HotShoe International<br><br>"Like most important international photojournalism, this work introduces most of us to the people who are left in the wake of much larger global influences. And this is also the conundrum of such compelling projects: to us they are the forgotten exotic ones; for them, this is their lives." -- Alan Rapp --Photo-Eye: The International Magazine of Photography Books<br><br>"Bendikesen's book conveys images of destruction, poverty and desperation, amplified by the gloomy times he chooses to press the shutter: dark evenings, winter and foggy days, of all... But there is also a certain warmth and strength depicted on people's faces, as well as the promise of the future to come ... Satellites is a dense and beautiful, yet emotional, probe of forgotten lands." -- Michaela Freeman --State of Art</p><h2>Midnight&#39;s Warrior: A Dark Warrior Novel (Dark Warriors, 4)</h2><p>Defenders against evil.

She lives with her husband, two children, a dog, and four cats in Texas.CHAPTER ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Dunnoth Tower <br>Northern Scotland <br>&nbsp; <br>Tara tapped her toe beneath her desk as she discreetly listened to her iPod in one ear. She quite enjoyed her job as a booking agent, tour guide, bookkeeper, and anything else they needed at the castle. <br>She hadn&#x2019;t thought about where she would go when she left Edinburgh after that disastrous run-in with the Warriors and Druids. She&#x2019;d driven and driven and driven until the road led her to the sea and Dunnoth Tower. <br>Tara had stopped at the medieval castle to eat and stretch her legs. She&#x2019;d been instantly taken with the structure and took the tour of it. To her surprise there had been a position open, and she&#x2019;d applied. She&#x2019;d started work that very day. <br>It had only been a few weeks, but she was thoroughly enjoying her time at Dunnoth, which she hadn&#x2019;t expected after teaching. Yet, she found the quiet and peace of the castle and the North Sea helped to settle the turmoil inside her. <br>It also helped that the owners were pleasant, her coworkers friendly, and the tourists so eager to learn about the castle that they weren&#x2019;t much of a problem to handle. <br>Although tourism in the middle of January in the far north of Scotland wasn&#x2019;t much to talk about. Most tourists were at the ski resorts, but come summer, the castle was going to be very busy. <br>Tara looked forward to it. For now, she was reading over the accounting books to make sure everything was in order, and taking bookings for the castle for the summer months. <br>A door opened to her left and in walked the newest member of the castle employees. Tara&#x2019;s mouth had dropped open the first time she saw the tall, black-headed hunk with the amazing gray eyes that seemed to see right into her soul. <br>That had been the day before. And now, she found herself staring at him again as he walked across the entryway and began to work on the electrical outlet that had shorted out months ago. <br>Though this time she did manage to keep her mouth closed and not make a complete fool of herself. <br>He filled out the navy short-sleeved tee to perfection with his thick shoulders and muscular arms. Yesterday evening they&#x2019;d been hit with a rain and snow mix, and he&#x2019;d gotten caught in it. When he&#x2019;d come rushing into the castle with his shirt plastered to his abs, she&#x2019;d been able to count each and every muscle in that washboard stomach of his. <br>The sight of it had made her wish she could see him without his shirt on to get a good glimpse of that tanned skin and ripped body. <br>Tara smiled. She&#x2019;d always been a sucker for a man who knew how to take care of himself. But with Ramsey it wasn&#x2019;t just his body. <br>It was his long, black hair that hung past his shoulders with just a hint of a wave to the shiny locks. He kept it pulled away from his face in a ponytail, but she longed to see him with it down. <br>Then there was his face. She sighed. And what a face it was. Sculpted jaw with just a small shadow of whiskers, square chin, strong nose, and a high forehead with black brows slashed over his eyes. His lips were full and wide, and he had eyelashes so thick, so black, that any woman would be envious. His steel-gray eyes held a hint of laughter in them, as if he knew far more than anyone around him, and he wasn&#x2019;t going to share. <br>&#x201c;Good morn,&#x201d; Ramsey said in his deep baritone voice. <br>A shiver raced over Tara&#x2019;s skin every time he spoke, as if her body were dialed into his husky voice. &#x201c;Morning, Ramsey.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What are you listening to?&#x201d; he asked. He stopped at the wall and bent to open his toolbox and pulled out a couple of tools. <br>Tara blinked. &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; <br>Ramsey glanced at her and smiled. &#x201c;Your music, lass. What are you listening to?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah&nbsp;&#x2026; Rihanna,&#x201d; she answered, still baffled that he had known she had her iPod on. She had turned it down low enough so that no one would hear, and the cords to her earplugs were hidden by her hair. <br>Tara&#x2019;s heart began to pound as her mind raced. Had the Warriors found her again? She scooted her rolling chair back, prepared to grab her purse and keys and run. <br>Until she spotted the white cord against her black sweater. <br>She looked at Ramsey to find him staring at her. After a moment, he shrugged and turned his back to her. <br>Tara released a long sigh and put her elbow on the desk before she dropped her head into her hand. She was so paranoid. She hated living her life this way, but for her, there wasn&#x2019;t another way. <br>Because she was a Druid. And not just any Druid. <br>She was a dangerous one. <br>Tara squeezed her eyes closed and thought over the past ten years of her life. It wasn&#x2019;t that she had had a good or bad childhood. It had been average, just like her grades in school. <br>Hell, she had been average. Average height, average looks, average clothes, average everything. <br>She had known since she was a small child that she had magic. It ran strong through her family, and it never worried her. That is, until the day of her eighteenth birthday and she learned far more about the Druids than she had ever been told before. <br>Her family had lied to her all those years before, telling her that all Druids were the same. Not only were there two different kinds of Druids&#x2014; <i>mies,</i> the good Druids, and <i>droughs,</i> the ones who dabbled in black magic and gave their souls to the Devil&#x2014;her family were all <i>droughs.</i> <br>That wasn&#x2019;t what bothered her. What had made her run from her family was their insistence that she become <i>drough</i> as well. They demanded she give her soul to Satan, which would have condemned her to Hell when she died. <br>For some odd, inexplicable reason, that didn&#x2019;t bother anyone in her family. Just her. And they didn&#x2019;t understand her. Not that they ever had before. <br>Tara hadn&#x2019;t wanted anything extraordinary out of life. She had just wanted a simple life. A husband who loved her, children surrounding her, and a house filled with lots of laughter. <br>Instead, she now couldn&#x2019;t stay anywhere too long before she had to leave again. Already she had spent ten years in Scotland, which was most likely ten years too long. She should have left and gone somewhere else when she ran away from her family, but she loved Scotland too much to leave. <br>However, she knew this was her last stop in her beloved land. She was going to have to leave. And it saddened her. <br>It was just five days until her birthday. She had always thought by the time she reached twenty-eight she&#x2019;d have at least two children. <br>Instead, she was alone. <br>She didn&#x2019;t even allow herself to make friends, because friends asked questions and became curious about her past. And she hated lying. So, she kept to herself. <br>There had been one time she made the mistake of thinking someone was a friend. But Declan Wallace had been anything but. <br>To this day she didn&#x2019;t know how he had found her in that pub in Aberdeen, but his good looks, charm, and silver tongue had done the trick for a scared, confused eighteen-year-old who had run away from home. <br>Tara should have known what kind of man he was, but she blamed her emotional state for having overlooked it. She had stayed at his mansion for a month before she learned he was a Druid. <br>When he didn&#x2019;t push her to undergo the ceremony to become <i>drough,</i> she worked with him on strengthening her magic for several more months. Tara had been careful about how much she used her magic. No one, least of all her, understood why her magic was so out of control. <br>But Declan had pressed her to use more of it, to learn to control it. He hadn&#x2019;t understood her reluctance, and she hadn&#x2019;t told him. Nothing had worked, yet he hadn&#x2019;t been upset. He seemed to enjoy the fact that her magic was all over the place. If her emotions were high, she could blow up a lightbulb without even trying. <br>Then, one night, she hadn&#x2019;t been able to sleep and she&#x2019;d ventured downstairs to get something to eat when she&#x2019;d overheard Declan&#x2019;s plans for her. <br>Once again Tara was on the run. <br>She knew eventually she would be caught. Would it be by her family? The Warriors hunting her? Or Declan? Who among them would end her life? Would they come in the middle of the night, or in the light of day? Did it even matter anymore? <br>&#x201c;Tara?&#x201d; <br>She jerked at the feel of Ramsey&#x2019;s hand on her arm. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she asked as she tugged the earphone out of her ear. <br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; His brow was knit, his gray eyes full of concern. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she lied. <br>He raised a thick black brow and flattened his lips. &#x201c;I doona believe you&#x2019;re telling me the truth, but I willna press you.&#x201d; <br>The heat of his body seared her skin through her sweater where his hand was, but it didn&#x2019;t hurt. What it did was cause her blood to heat and made her think of leaning close and pressing her lips against his. <br>She cleared her throat and looked away from his hypnotic eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Really,&#x201d; she said, and plastered on a smile as she glanced at him. <br>He released her and stepped back. Instantly she missed his nearness, his touch, and his heat. How he could walk around in a short-sleeved tee in this frigid January weather, with the snow outside several feet thick, she didn&#x2019;t know. But she wished she could do the same. <br>&#x201c;How long have you been at Dunnoth Tower?&#x201d; he asked as he once more knelt in front of the outlet on the opposite wall. <br>She hated when people asked her questions, but for some reason she wanted to answer Ramsey&#x2019;s. Which wasn&#x2019;t a good sign for her at all. &#x201c;A few weeks.&#x201d; <br>He pulled the outlet from the wall and inspected it before he twisted a few wires. &#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; he responded. <br>&#x201c;What brought you here?&#x201d; She licked her lips, refusing to wonder what made her ask her own question. She never did this. It made it appear as if she were interested in him when she needed to keep her distance. <br>But there was something so alluring, so fascinating about Ramsey that she couldn&#x2019;t help herself. <br>&#x201c;Chance, maybe.&#x201d; He shrugged and tightened a wire. &#x201c;Who knows? How about you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was driving and the road took me here.&#x201d; <br>He looked up and met her gaze. &#x201c;Definitely chance on your part.&#x201d; <br>She grinned as she leaned her forearms on her desk. She had no idea what had come over her, asking and answering questions. And she even left her answer open so Ramsey could ask something else. <br>But he didn&#x2019;t. <br>Because he didn&#x2019;t it gave her the insane urge to inquire about something else. Thankfully, the phone rang, saving her from making an utter fool of herself. <br>Tara kept glancing at Ramsey as she looked at the calendar to book a company conference. She grew agitated at the woman on the other end of the line because Ramsey was finishing up with the outlet and she was still on the phone. <br>And then Ramsey closed his toolbox and stood. He gave her a smile and walked away. <br>Tara sighed. &#x201c;I beg your pardon, ma&#x2019;am. I didn&#x2019;t hear that last bit. Could you repeat it?&#x201d; <br>As she wrote down the dates in the calendar and calculated the deposit, Tara told herself now wasn&#x2019;t the time to find a man she was interested in. <br>The problem was there was never a good time for her to get involved with anyone. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by Donna Grant <br></p><h2>LES RACINES DU MAL</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>Lethal Investments</h2><p>An apartment building.

UTOPIAN TRACE contains this essay, with Wilson&#39;s on air running commentary (in a green font), extensive updated notes (in maroon font), and dozens of color period and contemporary illustrations. The result is a kudos-proclaiming celebration of New York City&#39;s great and glorious Central Park, and those who created it, especially Frederick Law Olmsted, whom Wilson calls &#34;a hero of the people.&#34; In elegant, pulsing, yet economically descriptive sentences, Wilson presents and comments upon, a lengthy letter Olmsted wrote in July 1862, describing a visit to the North American Phalanx in New Jersey, an intentional community founded upon the aesthetic communitarian theories of Charles Fourier.</p><p>Peter Lamborn Wilson is co-author of <em>Green Hermeticism: Alchemy and Ecology</em> (Lindisfarne Books, 2007) and has published more than sixty books in 16 languages, including VANISHED SIGNS (Lunar Chandelier Collective), ESCAPE FOR THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND OTHER ESSAYS: FOURIER, MARX PROUDHOM AND NIETZSCHE (Autonomedia, 1998), <em>The Temple of Perseus at Panopolis, Pirate Utopias, Sacred Drift, Night Market Noodles</em>, and UTOPIAN TRACE (Logosophia, 2019), amongst many others, and the upcoming <em>Cauda Pavonis: Esoteric Antinomianism in the Yezidi Tradition</em> and <em>The American Revolution as a Gigantic Real Estate Scam</em>.<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s Peter Lamborn Wilson hosted a radio show on WBAI-FM in New York City. The publisher of <em>Utopian Trace </em>had saved some tapes of Wilson's radio show, one of which contained the broadcast of this paper, and gave them later to Wilson for his archives. It turned out that the broadcast featuring <em>Utopian Trace</em> had been lost. But, now found, it inspired the publication of this remarkable book.</p><p>The result is a kudos-proclaiming celebration of New York City's great and glorious Central Park, and those who created it, especially Frederick Law Olmsted, whom Wilson calls "a hero of the people."

Although I&#x2019;m a huge supporter of his and friend of his, how that has been challenged over time, as well as the separation with Ray Evernham when he left the team. It hasn&#x2019;t always been great, perfect and happy times. It was tough to tell myself that if I&#x2019;m going to write a book, I want it to be done in a way that shows who I truly am and the things I went through and not hold back. I think Joe Garner did an excellent job of pulling that out of me, although it was hard at times.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The first-ever authorized biography of Jeff Gordon, the four-time champion racing legend. For over a year, Garner interviewed and observed Gordon at races, special events, and at home. The book is based on extensive interviews with Gordon &#x2013; as well as in-depth interviews with dozens of family members, friends, competitors, and colleagues, some of whom have never gone on the record before. Jeff speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about his childhood, his much publicized divorce, those he competed against, his family, and life after racing. This fully illustrated hardcover biography will allow privileged access to a wealth of exclusive unseen and rare material from Gordon&#x2019;s personal photo and memorabilia collection. Gordon&#x2019;s meteoric rise through racing&#x2019;s ranks is a classic American success story.

Burke was at the wheel, driving toward a destination that wasn&#x2019;t even a point on a map. The instructions he was following were a list of distances and landmarks: they&#x2019;d crossed from Montana into North Dakota hours ago, but for all any of the four of them knew, their destination might be the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. <br> <i>It&#x2019;s Saturday morning,</i> Spirit thought wearily, feeling drunk from lack of sleep, as she gazed out the side window at the unchanging vista of fields and trees and distant mountains. It was spring&#x2014;almost April&#x2014;but the landscape looked barren to her. It was nothing like the place she&#x2019;d grown up. Her life was nothing like the one she&#x2019;d had the last time she&#x2019;d looked out a car window counting the weeks to summer. <br>Her life? It was an unreal nightmare, the stuff of B movies. Except it was happening, and it was almost uniformly horrible. <br>A year ago, Saturday had been a day to hang out with friends, to tease her younger sister, to make elaborate kitchen experiments with Dad or go on adventures with Mom. But that was before the&#x2014; <i>Don&#x2019;t call it an accident now, call it what it was. Murder.</i> Murder. Before the Shadow Knights murdered her family. Before everything changed. <br>Six months ago, she&#x2019;d just been told she was going to go to a place called Oakhurst because there was nowhere else for her to go with all her family dead. From the beginning, Spirit had known there was something <i>wrong</i> with Oakhurst. <i>Yeah, maybe the fact that someone was trying to kill us off might have been the hint</i>. But that was simplifying things; the facade that Oakhurst had kept up was too good. The whole horrible scope of how badly things were wrong had taken a while to figure out. In fact, it hadn&#x2019;t been until a week ago that she really understood, when she&#x2019;d gotten the last clues to put it all together. <br>She&#x2019;d been told when she arrived that Oakhurst wasn&#x2019;t a normal orphanage, but a school for magicians. Which had been unsettling, and scary, but could have been kind of cool if the people in charge hadn&#x2019;t been pitting every student against every other student, in a kind of just-sub-lethal Hunger Games. <br>But then she found out that if you had magic, Oakhurst&#x2019;s headmaster tracked you down and killed your family, and then made it look as if they&#x2019;d wanted you to be sent there. Loch&#x2019;s father had died in a hotel fire, Muirin&#x2019;s in an automobile accident, Addie&#x2019;s in a plane crash, Burke&#x2019;s in a home invasion. Hers, in another car crash. The method didn&#x2019;t matter. Only the results. That you got sent to Oakhurst, where the headmaster could decide if you were worth the effort of teaching. Because if he decided you weren&#x2019;t&#x2014;well, the Hunger Games stopped being <i>sub</i>-lethal. <br> <i>And I thought all along he&#x2019;d made a mistake about me, that I didn&#x2019;t have magic. But he hadn&#x2019;t.</i> She looked down at her hands. There was still a pale mark on the left one where her school ring had been. The stone changed color when it recognized your magic, and hers never had. <br>Until last night. <br> <i>And now I know I&#x2019;m a Spirit Mage, and I know my School of Magic is the School of Spirit, but that&#x2019;s all I know. They taught four Schools of Magic at Oakhurst. Dr. Ambrosius made everyone forget there were five.</i> <br>She didn&#x2019;t know why, but considering everything else, it almost didn&#x2019;t matter. Dr. Ambrosius wanted to bring everyone with magic to Oakhurst so he could either recruit them&#x2014;or kill them. Because in his world, there were only flunkies and enemies, and he wasn&#x2019;t just a magician. And his real name wasn&#x2019;t Ambrosius. <br>His real name was Mordred. <i>The</i> Mordred. Centuries ago, he&#x2019;d lost a war for a kingdom. His enemies had locked him in a prison they&#x2019;d hoped would last forever&#x2014;but just in case it didn&#x2019;t, his jailers had cast a second spell, binding all of them to be reborn over and over until the threat was ended forever. To become <i>Reincarnates,</i> unaware of who they&#x2019;d been until Merlin&#x2014;or Mordred&#x2014;awakened their memories. <br>Merlin. Mordred. Arthur. Guinevere. Names out of a storybook until Spirit and her friends discovered it wasn&#x2019;t a story&#x2014;it was something they were all living. Because Dr. Ambrosius was Mordred, and once he&#x2019;d escaped his prison, he gathered an army of Shadow Knights to serve him, and spent decades hunting the Grail Knights who were the only challengers to his power. <br>He built Oakhurst as the means to do that. He eliminated every magician who wouldn&#x2019;t serve him before they could even begin to threaten him. And who would ever have believed he was doing anything like that, when no one in the outside world had so much as a <i>clue</i> that magic was real? <br>A day ago, Spirit finally found a way for the five of them to escape from Oakhurst. If escape had been their only goal, there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any point&#x2014;but escape was only the beginning of what they were going to have to do. <br> <i>Save the world. Why is it that&#x2019;s always what it turns out to be?</i> <br>Maybe because when it was <i>things</i> like Mordred you were up against, they weren&#x2019;t going to settle for anything less than the world. <br>It was Muirin who&#x2019;d infiltrated the Shadow Knights to discover Mordred planned to trigger a nuclear apocalypse to create a world where Magic, not Science, ruled. They&#x2019;d fled knowing they were the only ones who had a chance to stop it. A mysterious ally Spirit knew only as QUERCUS had given them a place to go. <br>But escape had come at far too high a price. <br>The van hit another pothole, and Spirit groaned faintly. <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Burke said, glancing at her apologetically. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thinking about Muirin,&#x201d; she said. She closed her eyes hard, willing herself not to cry. It wouldn&#x2019;t do any good. Muirin would still be dead. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>Muirin clung to Doc Mac&#x2019;s arm as the dancers at the Spring Fling swirled around them, oblivious. She looked greenish-pale, and the dark smudges under her eyes had nothing to do with makeup. Spirit saw her lurch and stagger, and only Doc Mac&#x2019;s grip on her arm kept her from falling.</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;Muirin!&#x201d; Spirit cried.</i> <br> <i>She pushed through the crowd, shoving people out of her way as she headed for Muirin. She was about halfway there when Muirin saw her. She brought her hand up and made a throwing motion. The car keys came flying through the air, and Spirit snatched them without thought. Muirin silently mouthed one word:</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;Run.&#x201d;</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Not everyone with magic was a Reincarnate, but Spirit had been sure about Muirin. Anastus Ovcharenko&#x2014;Shadow Knight and Mordred&#x2019;s pet assassin&#x2014;had called Muirin and Madison Lane-Rider &#x201c;sisters&#x201d;&#x2014;and that made Madison Lane-Rider Queen Morgause and Muirin Queen Morgaine. Madison was a Shadow Knight, and Muirin had played a long double game, pretending she wanted to join them while remaining loyal to her friends. Maybe Murr-cat had been tempted to swap sides&#x2014;maybe she&#x2019;d even come close, and who could have blamed her? The other side had&nbsp;&#x2026; everything. What did her friends have? But Muirin had stuck with them. Without Muirin&#x2019;s last-minute warning&#x2014;without her <i>help</i>&#x2014;Mordred would have gotten all five of them. <br>Instead of only one of them. <br>Burke reached out a hand and closed it over hers. &#x201c;They will pay for that. I swear it,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Do you think&#x2014;?&#x201d; she said, hating herself for hoping. She&#x2019;d seen Muirin fall, shot by Anastus Ovcharenko&#x2014;Prince Agravaine. But maybe.&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Burke said quietly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d never have trusted her after she helped us. He shot to kill.&#x201d; <br> <i>I won&#x2019;t cry,</i> Spirit told herself desperately, but despite her best efforts, a tear slid down her cheek. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no sin to grieve,&#x201d; Burke said gently. <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time,&#x201d; Spirit answered angrily. &#x201c;Mordred&#x2019;s going to nuke the world back to the Stone Age!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We have time to mourn for our friend. Mordred moves on Beltane,&#x201d; Burke said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s May first. It&#x2019;s only the end of March now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; Spirit said, rubbing her eyes, her throat and heart aching. &#x201c;Six weeks to save the world.&#x201d; <br>Silence hung between them, stretching the tension to the breaking point. &#x201c;I hope this Internet buddy of yours can help,&#x201d; Burke finally said, awkwardly changing the subject. <br>She took the change of subject gratefully, thankful for his kindness. &#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Spirit answered somberly. <br>&#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d; Loch asked, sitting up and leaning forward between the seats. He and Addie were riding in the back. Spirit could have ridden in back too, and maybe even gotten some sleep&#x2014;QUERCUS had left the van for them, along with the directions to reach their destination&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d wanted to be with Burke. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me pull this getaway car over,&#x201d; Burke said lightly, and despite everything, Spirit smiled. <br>She&#x2019;d never had a boyfriend before. She&#x2019;d never expected to find one at Oakhurst. After her family died, she&#x2019;d just wanted to shut out the world, and never care about anyone again. But Burke had loved her&#x2014;as simply and as uncomplicatedly as breathing&#x2014;from almost the moment he&#x2019;d first seen her. When she&#x2019;d realized she was in love with him too, it was too late to turn back and pretend she wasn&#x2019;t. It was the most wonderful thing in her life. It was the most terrible thing too, because she&#x2019;d known they were all in danger before the first time Burke had kissed her, and the thought she could lose him the way she&#x2019;d lost her family was terrifying. <br>To lose anyone else, really, and she&#x2019;d already lost Muirin, and she knew it hadn&#x2019;t really sunk in yet, but it already hurt so much she just wanted to scream until she couldn&#x2019;t scream any more. <br>&#x201c;Are we going to be awake now?&#x201d; Addie asked grumpily, sitting up next to Loch. She glanced out the windshield. &#x201c;Ugh. It looks the same as it did the last time I looked. Where are we going?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but we&#x2019;re making good time,&#x201d; Burke joked. <br>They were all concentrating on trivial stuff, or trying to, and Spirit didn&#x2019;t blame them. Easier not to talk about the danger, the deaths, the fact they weren&#x2019;t safe, even now. &#x201c;Wherever it is, we should be there in a couple of hours, tops,&#x201d; Spirit said, waving the sheaf of directions. &#x201c;According to this, anyway.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I hope wherever it is it involves thick walls and strong doors,&#x201d; Loch said. &#x201c;And maybe landmines. Because I&#x2019;m pretty sure Breakthrough isn&#x2019;t going to stop chasing us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not if Mordred wants them to,&#x201d; Addie said, shuddering. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be the one he got mad at.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Except you totally are,&#x201d; Loch pointed out. &#x201c;We all are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Burke said reasonably. &#x201c;But at least we can run for our lives. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be one of his henchmen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think <i>Mark</i> wants to be one of his henchmen right now, either,&#x201d; Addie said. <br>&#x201c;Too bad,&#x201d; Spirit said venomously. &#x201c;He had the same choice everyone else got, and he chose Mordred.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, cake or death, great choice,&#x201d; Loch said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not excusing him&#x2014;his so-called &#x2018;security people&#x2019; killed our families, as I&#x2019;m sure we all remember&#x2014;but he probably never expected the Evil Overlord&#x2019;s plan to be starting a nuclear war just so he didn&#x2019;t have to deal with the real world.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make <i>sense</i>,&#x201d; Addie said plaintively. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a magician&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve all seen how much power he has. Mordred could probably have taken over a country and made himself king years ago. There are thousands of places where if you walked in and said you could cure disease and make the crops grow and could prove it, they&#x2019;d fall all over themselves to hand you the keys to the kingdom.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So to speak,&#x201d; Loch said, with a wry smile. &#x201c;Stubborn and stupid is a bad combination, but he&#x2019;s just like a lot of CEOs my father dealt with. And remember&#x2014;Mordred isn&#x2019;t a Reincarnate.&#x201d; <br>Suddenly, some of this made a twisted sort of sense to Spirit. Mordred had been Mordred for centuries. He&#x2019;d never been anyone else. He still thought like a Dark Age tyrant. After all this time, he was probably crazier than a cageful of bats, too, but everything he was, everything he defaulted to, was the man who&#x2019;d been born in a time when a state-of-the-art weapon was a steel sword or a powerful magician. Maybe he really didn&#x2019;t comprehend what a nuclear war would <i>do</i> to the world. Maybe he just thought of it as burned crops, leveled cities, and poisoned wells on a mass scale. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still Mordred,&#x201d; Spirit said, realizing. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s never been anyone else. Not like the others.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not like us,&#x201d; Burke said. <br>Spirit looked at him in surprise. &#x201c;Us?&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Reincarnates?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; Loch said. &#x201c;The odds are at least <i>one</i> of us is a former <i>Knight Who Says Ni.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Besides Muirin,&#x201d; Addie said quietly. <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Burke said, and after that nobody said anything for a while. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Addie said, pulling the van to a halt. <br>It was a little after noon. Loch had taken over from Burke, and Addie from Loch: Spirit was the only one who didn&#x2019;t know how to drive, and seeing the weariness on her friends&#x2019; faces that made her feel guilty now. They&#x2019;d all been awake over twenty-four hours, and to add driving to that.&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Not where I&#x2019;d choose to make my last stand,&#x201d; Loch said, looking around the parking lot and back at the seedy strip motel. <br>They&#x2019;d been seeing signs for Omaha for a while&#x2014;that and Offutt Air Force Base&#x2014;but where their directions had led them was to a middle-of-nowhere place that was barely a wide spot in the road: gas station, motel, diner. If there was a town anywhere nearby, or even some random houses, they weren&#x2019;t visible from the Alvo Motor Hotel. There wasn&#x2019;t even a McDonald&#x2019;s. <br>&#x201c;Well, there aren&#x2019;t any more directions,&#x201d; Addie said, waving the last sheet of paper. &#x201c;But.&#x2026; We aren&#x2019;t that far from Omaha.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This is where QUERCUS sent us,&#x201d; Spirit said reluctantly. &#x201c;This is where he&#x2019;ll expect to find us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And what then? What do we do then?&#x201d; Addie asked, a little shrilly. &#x201c;Is he going to hand us a magic sword? Or turn us into superheroes? Sure, we&#x2019;ve got magic&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve <i>all</i> got magic&#x2014;but so do they.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Spirit said softly. Addie had always doubted their ability&#x2014;her <i>own</i> ability&#x2014;to fight back, and Spirit really couldn&#x2019;t blame her. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know what else to do.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And we&#x2019;re all just about out on our feet,&#x201d; Burke said. &#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t going anywhere except off the side of the road if we don&#x2019;t get some rest. If this is our only option, well, it&#x2019;s our only option.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So let&#x2019;s go see what&#x2019;s behind Door Number Six,&#x201d; Loch said. <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go find out if it&#x2019;s locked,&#x201d; Addie said pragmatically. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Spirit blinked at the brightness of the sunlight as she stepped out of the van. Her shoes&#x2014;the strappy silver sandals Madison Lane-Rider had picked out as part of her Spring Fling outfit&#x2014;slid on the asphalt, and she grabbed for the doorframe. <br>&#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; Burke said, putting a hand under her arm. <br>The coat QUERCUS had left for him in the van hung open; the tuxedo beneath it looked jarringly out of place. They were all still wearing their prom clothes under their coats, but at least Spirit&#x2019;s dress was short. Addie was wearing an ankle-length velvet gown; it caught on something as she slid out of the driver&#x2019;s seat, and Spirit heard her snarl as she ripped it free and slammed the door as hard as she could. <br>&#x201c;At this point I don&#x2019;t actually care if the Legions of Hell are in there,&#x201d; Loch said, slamming the back door of the van, &#x201c;as long as I can sit down somewhere that isn&#x2019;t moving.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; Burke said.

After leaving <i>Analog</i> in 1978, he continued his editorial work in science fiction, serving as fiction editor of<i> Omni</i> for several years and editing a number of anthologies and lines of books, including the "Ben Bova Presents" series for Tor. He has won science fiction's Hugo Award for Best Editor six times.<br><br>A published SF author from the late 1950s onward, Bova is one of the field's leading writers of "hard SF," science fiction based on plausible science and engineering. Among his dozens of novels are <i>Millennium, The Kinsman Saga, Colony, Orion, Peacekeepers, Privateers,</i> and the<i> Voyagers</i> series. Much of his recent work, including <i>Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, The Precipice, </i>and<i> The Rock Rats</i>, falls into the continuity he calls "The Grand Tour," a large-scale saga of the near-future exploration and development of our solar system. <br><br>A President Emeritus of the National Space Society and a past president of Science-fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, in 2001 Dr. Bova was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He lives in Naples, Florida, with his wife, the well-known literary agent Barbara Bova.<br>The intrigues of fourth-century-B.C. Macedonia and Greece are brought vividly to life in this sweeping historical fantasy. To avert the possibility that the strands of space-time might unravel, Orion, rebellious instrument of the Creators previously encountered in Orion in the Dying Time , is sent to the court of Philip II to ensure that his son Alexander succeeds in his territorial conquests. Orion comes to admire Philip but falls under the control of his wife (and Alexander's mother) Olympias, an embodiment of the Creator Hera. Olympias is determined to arrange the assassination of Philip so that Alexander may gain the throne before a rival heir can be born to the king's new wife. Orion fights in the battle at Chaeroneia, where Macedonia defeats Athens and Thebes, and is sent to Persia where he is forced to desert when he has an opportunity to meet with his great love Anya, a Creator fighting other battles in a different time. She urges him to obey Olympias to save the Creators' universe. Despite Orion's admiration for the Macedonian king and all his attempts to flee his doom, he is drawn into a final confrontation. Bova's adroit use of detail makes the time setting ring true; his depictions of historic personages as well as his fictional creations are psychologically sound. The sounds, the scents and the sensibility of the ancient world permeate this well-wrought adventure. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hemingway&#39;s Notebook</h2><p>The November Man journeys to the politically explosive Caribbean island of St. Michel and discovers an American agent who claims to possess Hemingway&#39;s journal of his Cuban sojourn during the Bay of Pigs, a notebook alleging CIA and Mafia involvement in the region</p><p>Twenty-five years ago in Cuba, Harry Francis played prankish games with Ernest Hemingway while working for the CIA. Now Harry lives and drinks on the Caribbean island of St. Michel, where rebels in the hills fight the government and where another former agent, Col. Ready, heads the army. Harry is rumored to have a notebook from his Cuba years that confirms the extent and stupidity of CIA involvement in the Bay of Pigs debacle. The CIA wants the notebook, as does R Section, a group set up by Kennedy in '61 to "watch the watchers." Ready wants the notebook too, and flushes another ex-agent, code-named November, from hiding, coercing him into going after it. The CIA, arm-in-arm with organized crime, launches an invasion of St. Michel by paramilitary exiles. November finds the notebook; R Section watches. Using them all to his own ends, Ready is a master player. But so is November, who needs to outplay the opposition to save the woman he loves. Truth, fiction and history peel in layers. Grainger, author of The November Man, has been compared to le Carre, Ludlum and Fleming. But this lean, suspenseful tale, peopled with compelling characters, has a drive and signature all its own.

Discovered by Colonel Ready, another ex-CIA agent turned mercenary, Devereaux is blackmailed into joining the colonel on St. Michel, a Caribbean island which just happens to be overburdened with guerrillas in the hills, a mad president, and a bumbling local CIA agent. Colonel Ready runs the army and holds Devereaux's girlfriend as a hostage. There is so much rape, torture, murder, and general violence in this spy thriller that it actually gets in the way of the thin plot. The characters are equally thin and unappealing.

Everything in this novel is outsized: the setting, a jungle still populated by cannibals; the characters, including Villegagnon, the expedition's eccentric leader, who might be a model for Cyrano or d'Artagnan; and the events, a dress rehearsal for the Wars of Religion ten years in the future. Packed with portraits, landscapes, and action, <em>Brazil Red</em> is a novel about coming of age and discovering love. On a deeper level, the story follows the destinies and decisions of Just and Colombe, presenting two conflicting views of man and nature. On one hand, a conquering European civilization, offering liberation but delivering death. On the other, the Indian world, with its sensuality, its harmony, its sense of the sacred, its continual call to happiness.</p><p>Jean-Christophe Rufin is a founder of Doctors without Borders and author of the prize-winning first novel The Abyssinian. He lives in France.A page-turner that won the Prix Goncourt in 2001, Rufin's third offering (after <i>The Abyssinian</i> and <i>The Siege of Isfahan</i>) fits neatly into the romance novel mold of beautiful maidens, brave knights and dastardly villains. The story centers on the plight of two 16th-century French orphans, Just and Colombe, who are tricked into joining a colonial expedition to subjugate Brazil. The enterprise is commanded by Chevalier Durand de Villegagnon, a colonist whose actual memoirs provided Rufin with some of the details that inspired this novel. Once across the ocean, Villegagnon prematurely dubs Brazil the "New France" and sets about combating his enemies: the hot Brazilian sun, the native residents and the Portuguese, who claimed sole right to Brazil long before. Years roll by and as the action proceeds, a question hovers portentously over the book: will the orphans grow up to be cruel colonialists or secular humanists who appreciate the Indians' wisdom? Rufin provides plenty of rousing action, yet somehow, despite the author's historical research, the book never rises far above melodrama. This is partly due to tired word choice and to the playlike structure of scenes that end with a conveniently chiming clock or thunder in the distance. Mostly, however, it is the natural consequence of the novel's overly neat divide between good and evil. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Today, Tibet's peaceful, integrated way of life; deeply felt Buddhist tradition; and its culture rich in art, architecture, dance and music have all but disappeared, gradually replaced by the trappings of life introduced since the Chinese take-over of the 1950's. Most of the 3,000 monasteries and temples that once dotted the Tibetan countryside have been destroyed or converted into museums. Only in a few scattered �migr� communities, in the treasures hastily smuggled out by 100,000 refugees who fled Tibet in 1959, and in a handful of photographs, is the old Tibet remembered and preserved.<br><br><i>Tibet: The Sacred Realm</i> brings together for the first time a selection of more than 140 of these rare photographs, taken from 1880 to 1950 by more than twenty intrepid adventurers, naturalists, explorers, scientists, and missionaries, who were among the very few in the West to travel in Tibet. In this valuable visual record the forward-looking thirteenth Dalai Lama sits in exile in India surrounded by his high officials; one of Tibet's wealthiest families poses in their Western-style dining room; the artificial lake of Lhasa reflects the imposing gilded roofs of the Potala Palace; Buddhist monks perform sacred dances in ornate animal masks; pilgrims circumambulate the holy city; and monks and sheepskin-bundled nomads gather on the vast northern plains to listen for the first time to a visitor's gramaphone.<br><br>Selected from the collections of twenty-three institutions' archives and private source in Europe and the United States, the photographs represent the finest work of the explorer-photographers Alexandra David-N�el, Brooke Dolan, George Taylor, Ilya Tolstoy, and Claude White, among others, including the Tibetan photographer Sonam Wangfel Laden-La. Facing inclement weather, the threats of bandits, the objections of the lamas, and countless other hardships, these photographers still managed to distill the essence of Tibet's mystery and fascination.<br><br>Recalling his early years in Tibet, Buddhist scholar, translator, and son of the former chief state oracle of Tibet, Lobsang P. Lhalungpa adds another dimension to the story revealed in the photographs. He shares his recollections of a boyhood in Lhasa, his training under the most revered Tibetan lamas, his life as a monk official in the Dalai Lama's government, and his sorrowful departure from his native land: "I mounted my favorite gelding, which had been saddled with its finest saddle cover. As I bent down to tuck the folds of my clothes under one leg, my round, fur-and-brocade-trimmed hat slipped off my head and fell to the ground. I remember feeling instant apprehension. Was this a sign that I would never see Lhas again?"<br><br>As the technological age threatens to swallow, one by one, the unique civilizations of the world, the lessons to be learned from the age-old traditions of Tibet become all the more valuable. Tibet's past, illuminated here by glimpses of special vision, offers profound spiritual insight and a majestic feast for the eye.<br><br>The photographs are introduced by a preface by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.<br></p><p><b>Lobsang P. Lhalungpa</b> was born in Lhasa in 1924 and passed through the disciplines of the major branches of Tibetan Buddhism under many of its greatest masters. Assigned to India at the time the Chinese took over Tibet in the 1950's, he has since lived in India and the West. His life has drawn him into all aspects of the effort to maintain the Tibetan tradition by bringing it into relationship to Western needs. A consulting editor and contributor to the quarterly journal <i>Parabola</i> and consultant to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, he is also a former teacher of Tibetan Buddhist classics at the University of British Columbia. As a translator, he has rendered important Buddhist texts into English, including <i>The Life of Milarepa</i>, and his translation of <i>Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation</i>.<br>"Whatever the fate of Tibet, the spiritual essence of the Sacred Realm remains in the hearts of the Tibetan people. Our cultural heritage lives, too, in the handful of photographs taken in our country before 1950, all the more precious because they preserve a sense of time and place that now exists only in our memories."--Lobsang P.

Her knowledge of human nature is remarkable, and her awareness of the importance of class, money and appearances makes her a peculiarly modern author. She addresses the politics of dating, courtship and mating with an incisive intelligence that both foreshadows and outstrips romantic novels of today. Her teasing novels of gentle worldliness have been brought to new audiences by modern film and television productions, and this complete edition of her full-length novels - Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Northanger Abbey - will be a welcome addition to any library or collection of books. This edition contains the delightful illustrations of Hugh Thomson, the finest illustrator of Jane Austen&#39;s works. Biography Jane Austen&#39;s delightful, carefully wrought novels of manners remain surprisingly relevant, nearly 200 years after they were first published. Her novels -- Pride and Prejudice and Emma among them -- are those rare books that offer us a glimpse at the mores of a specific period while addressing the complexities of love, honor, and responsibility that still intrigue us today.</p><p></p><h2>Mosdos Press Literature: Jade Workbook</h2><p>Book by Factor, Judith</p><p></p><h2>Rendezvous country (Images of America series)</h2><p>deluxe hardback edition in slipcase</p><p></p><h2>Story Bible: Old Testament: 001</h2><p>Stories from the Old Testament in the Bible by famous author Pearl S.

The light softened, the nights grew crisp, while the days remained warm. This Thursday, September 18, there was only a vague tinge of yellow at the top of the willow trees, which would become a cascade of color by mid-October.<br><br>The old 1978 Ford F-150 rumbled along the macadam road. The big engine's sound thrilled Harry. If it had a motor in it, she liked it.<br><br>Her two cats, Mrs. Murphy, a tiger, and Pewter, a gray cat, along with her corgi, Tee Tucker, also enjoyed the rumble, which often put them to sleep. Today, all sitting on the bench seat, they were wide awake. A trip to town meant treats and visiting other animals, plus one never knew what would happen.<br><br>Harry had just turned forty on August 7, and she declared it didn't faze her. Maybe. Maybe not. Fair, her adored husband, threw a big surprise birthday party and she reveled in being the center of attention, even though it was for entering her Middle Ages. She wore the gorgeous horseshoe ring her husband had bought her at the Shelbyville Horse Show. She wasn't much for display or girly things, but every time she looked down at the glitter, she grinned.<br><br>"All right, kids, you behave. You hear me? I don't want you jumping on Tazio's blueprints. No knocking erasers on the floor. No chewing the rubber ends of pencils. Tucker." Harry's voice kept the command tone. "Don't you dare steal Brinkley's bones. I mean it."<br><br>The three animals cast their eyes at her, those eyes brimming with love and the promise of obedience.<br><br>Tazio Chappars, a young architect in Crozet, won large commissions for public buildings, but she also accepted a healthy string of commissions for beautiful, expensive homes, most paid for by non-Virginians. The houses were too flashy for a blue-blood Virginian. However, Tazio, like all of us in this world, needed to make a living, so if the client wanted a marble-clad bathroom as big as most people's garages, so be it.<br><br>As Harry parked, she noticed a brand-new Range Rover in the small lot. Painted a burnt orange, she walked over to admire it.<br><br>"Good wheels," she muttered to herself.<br><br>Good indeed, but the closest dealer was ninety miles away in Richmond, which somewhat dimmed the appeal. If that didn't do it, the price did.<br><br>Before she reached the door, a stream of invective assaulted her ears. When she opened the door, the blast hit her.<br><br>"Wormwood! I don't care what it costs and I don't care if termites get in it. I want wormwood!" An extremely well cared for woman in her mid-forties shook colored plans in Tazio's face.<br><br>"Mrs. Paulson, I understand. But it's going to slow down the library because it takes months to secure it."<br><br>"I don't care. You'll do what I tell you."<br><br>Tazio, face darkening, said nothing.<br><br>Mrs. Paulson spun around on her bright aqua three-hundred-dollar shoes to glare at Harry. Harry's white T-shirt revealed an ample chest, and her jeans hugged a trim body with a healthy tan. Mrs. Paulson paused for a minute because, even though not of Virginia, she had divined that often the richest people or the ones with the oldest blood wore what to her were migrant-labor fashions. Carla Paulson wouldn't be caught dead in a white T-shirt and Wranglers. She couldn't fathom why Harry would appear in public looking like a farmhand.<br><br>She knew Harry in passing, so she switched into "lunch lady" mode.<br><br>Tazio stepped around her drafting table. "Mrs. Paulson, you remember Harry Haristeen; her mother was a Hepworth. Her father, a Minor." Tazio knew perfectly well that Mrs. Paulson didn't know the bloodlines, but the simple fact that Tazio recited them meant "important person."<br><br>Not that Harry gave a damn.<br><br>Extending her hand, radiating a smile, the well-groomed woman purred, "Of course, I remember."<br><br>Harry politely took her hand, using the exact amount of pressure all those battleaxes at cotillion drilled into her year after year. "I can see you've hired the most talented architect in the state." She paused. "Love your new wheels."<br><br>"Isn't the interior beautiful? Just bought it last week." Carla Paulson brightened. She checked her diamond-encrusted Rolex. "Well, I'll call later for another appointment. Oh, before I forget, Michael McElvoy said he'd be out at the site tomorrow at eleven."<br><br>Tazio wanted to say she had an appointment then, which she did, but if one of the county building inspectors was going to be at the construction site, then she'd better be there, too. Michael lived to find fault.<br><br>"Fine. I'll be there." Tazio smiled and walked Mrs. Paulson to the door, while Mrs. Murphy and Pewter jumped on the high chair and onto the drafting table. Those pink erasers thrilled the cats. Tazio even had special white square ones that squeaked when bitten.<br><br>Brinkley, a young yellow lab rescued by Tazio during a snowstorm at a half-completed building site, chewed his bone. Tucker lay down in front of the wonderful creature and put her head on her paws to stare longingly at the bone.<br><br>Once Carla Paulson exited, Tazio exhaled loudly.<br><br>"Murphy, Pewter, what did I tell you?" Harry warned.<br><br>Murphy batted the square white eraser off the table. Both cats sailed after it.<br><br>"Don't worry about it. I have a carton full of them back in the supply closet. In fact, I'll give you one." She took another breath. "That woman is plucking my last nerve. I thought Folly Steinhauser was high maintenance and Penny Lattimore a diva, but Carla is in a class by herself."<br><br>"I can see that."<br><br>Tazio slyly smiled. "The diamond Rolex watch is so over the top."<br><br>"Better to wear plain platinum. Worth more and not showy. In fact, most people think it's steel." Harry leaned on the drafting table. "But if Carla owned a platinum Rolex, she'd have to tell everyone it wasn't steel and ruin it, of course."<br><br>"Harry," Tazio laughed, "you're so Virginia."<br><br>"Oh, look who's talking."<br><br>"I'm from St. Louis, remember."<br><br>"Doesn't matter. You mentioned that gaudy watch. I didn't."<br><br>Tazio was half Italian, half African-American, and all gorgeous. Her family, prominent in St. Louis, had provided her with the best education as well as a great deal of social poise, since her mother was on every committee imaginable. From the time she was small, her mother had marched her to different parties, balls, fund-raisers.<br><br>"I'm worn out, because she keeps changing her mind. Well, I'll grant, she's been consistent about the wormwood, but every time she changes something the cost spirals upward. It's not my money, but you move a window an inch and either Orrie"-she named the head of construction by his nickname-"or I have to call the building inspector. Michael McElvoy, as you heard."<br><br>Harry started to giggle. "Lucky you."<br><br>"Oh, well, everyone has their problems. You came to pick up the numbers on the different heating systems for St. Luke's. Got 'em." She walked back to her large, polished mahogany desk, about ten feet from the drafting table. Picking up a folder, she said, "Here. Digest it, then let's go over it before the next vestry meeting."<br><br>Harry flipped open the folder. "Jeez."<br><br>"Lots of choices, and each one has pluses and minuses."<br><br>"Herb have a copy?" Harry mentioned the pastor of St. Luke's, Rev. Herb Jones.<br><br>"I thought we should put our heads together first. Anyway, he's on overload because of the St. Luke's reunion next month."<br><br>The reunion would be Saturday, October 25. Each October, St. Luke's held a gathering of all its members. Many who had moved away from central Virginia returned, so the numbers ran to about three hundred.<br><br>"Okay. I'll get right on this. Be nice to have this installed before the reunion, just in case the weather does turn cold."<br><br>"With luck the old boiler ought to hold out for another month or two. First frost usually hits us mid-October. We'll make it, I hope. You know, that old furnace is cast iron. A welder will need to dismantle it to get it out of there. That will take days. They don't build things like they used to," Tazio said with a big grin.<br><br>Harry finally noticed Tucker. "What did I tell you?"<br><br>Tazio walked back to the supply room, returning with a dog treat called a Greenies. She handed it to a grateful Tucker. "Made in Missouri."<br><br>"Well, then it has to be good." Harry laughed. "Come on, kids."<br><br>"I want the eraser." Mrs. Murphy carried the item in her mouth.<br><br>Harry had reached down to pluck it from those jaws when Tazio said, "Keep it. Really. I have a carton."<br><br>"Thanks. You spoil my buddies."<br><br>"You don't?" An eyebrow arched over one green eye.<br><br>"Well . . ."<br><br>"If you spoiled Fair like you spoil these three, he'd be fat as a tick." Tazio mentioned Harry's husband, who was six five, all muscle.<br><br>"You know, I don't think Fair will ever get fat. For one thing, if he doesn't work it off, he'll worry it off."<br><br>"He doesn't strike me as a worrier."<br><br>"Maybe not in the traditional sense, but he's always thinking about the future, investigating new technology and medications. His mind never stops."<br><br>"Neither does yours. That's why you were made for each other."<br><br>"Guess so. All right, madam. I'll get back to you." She paused. "Speaking of made for each other, you and Paul seem to be."<br><br>Tazio shrugged and blushed.<br><br>Harry opened the door and the three happy friends scooted out ahead of...</p><h2>McBroom&#39;s Wonderful One-Acre Farm: Three Tall Tales</h2><p>For twenty-five years, young readers have giggled over Josh McBroom&#39;s farm, where the acres are piled on top of each other and things grow uncontrollably, and now they will laugh triply hard at an anniversary collection of three McBroom tales.</p><p><p>Sid Fleischman wrote more than sixty books for children, adults, and magicians.

Stowe provides an in-depth study of the midcentury culture of everyday medicine in the South. Reading deeply in the personal letters, daybooks, diaries, bedside notes, and published writings of doctors, Stowe illuminates an entire world of sickness and remedy, suffering and hope, and the deep ties between medicine and regional culture.<br><br>In a distinct American region where climate, race and slavery, and assumptions about "southernness" profoundly shaped illness and healing in the lives of ordinary people, Stowe argues that southern doctors inhabited a world of skills, medicines, and ideas about sickness that allowed them to play moral, as well as practical, roles in their communities. Looking closely at medical education, bedside encounters, and medicine's larger social aims, he describes a "country orthodoxy" of local, social medical practice that highly valued the "art" of medicine. While not modern in the sense of laboratory science a century later, this country orthodoxy was in its own way modern, Stowe argues, providing a style of caregiving deeply rooted in individual experience, moral values, and a consciousness of place and time.<br><br></p><p>"A richly evocative reconstruction of medicine and medical practice.

Stearn (1911&#x2013;2001) was one of Britain's most eminent botanists. During a career based first at the Royal Horticultural Society, then at the Natural History Museum, Stearn wrote some 470 books, articles, and monographs, ranging from detailed studies of plant genera, through histories and biographies, to books on botanical taxonomy, many of which have become standard works of reference.</p><h2>East of Eden (Oprah&#39;s Classics Book Club Selections)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br><br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br><br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br><br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br><br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 1<br><br>[1]<br><br> THE SALINAS VALLEY is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.<br><br>I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time the birds awaken in the summer&#x2014;and what trees and seasons smelled like&#x2014;how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.<br><br>I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding&#x2014;unfriendly and dangerous. I always found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the Santa Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feeling about the two ranges of mountains.<br><br>From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of the Salinas River. In the winter of wet years the streams ran full-freshet, and they swelled the river until sometimes it raged and boiled, bank full, and then it was a destroyer. The river tore the edges of the farm lands and washed whole acres down; it toppled barns and houses into itself, to go floating and bobbing away. It trapped cows and pigs and sheep and drowned them in its muddy brown water and carried them to the sea. Then when the late spring came, the river drew in from its edges and the sand banks appeared. And in the summer the river didn&#x2019;t run at all above ground. Some pools would be left in the deep swirl places under a high bank. The tules and grasses grew back, and willows straightened up with the flood debris in their upper branches. The Salinas was only a part-time river. The summer sun drove it underground. It was not a fine river at all, but it was the only one we had and so we boasted about it&#x2014;how dangerous it was in a wet winter and how dry it was in a dry summer. You can boast about anything if it&#x2019;s all you have. Maybe the less you have, the more you are required to boast.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Impossibly</h2><p><i></i><p><i> "The first time we met, it was about a stapler, I think." </i></p><p>Deadpan delivery and a sly eye for detail characterize the anonymous secret agent in Laird Hunt's tense, funny spy noir.<i> </i>When the nameless narrator botches an assignment for the clandestine organization that employs him, everyone in his life&#x2014;including his new girlfriend&#x2014;is revealed to be either true-blue, double operative, or both.</p><p>With the literary coyness of Paul Auster and the dark absurdity of Kafka, Hunt's debut is a daring, memory-driven narrative that is as fittingly spare as a bare ceiling light&#x2014;and just as pendulous. On the surface, the narrator is a simple man, fixing his washer and dryer, strolling through city parks, falling in love at an office supply store. But in <i>The Impossibly,</i> the mundane gives way to outrageous misconduct, and with each unexpected visitor or cryptic note, the tension reaches tantalizing heights. As the narrator frugally doles out clues about his dangerous work in an unnamed European city, the reader inevitably becomes confidante and fellow gumshoe. The narrator's final assignment&#x2014;to identify his own assassin&#x2014;dismantles the reader's own analysis of the evidence.</p><p><b>Marketing Plans:</b></p><p>�National author tour includes: East Coast, West Coast, Minneapolis/St. Paul</p><p>� Co-op available</p><p><b>Laird Hunt</b> is an editor for the Department of Public Information at the United Nations, and is New York correspondent for London's <i>Mouth-to-Mouth</i> Magazine.

He lives in New York City.</p></p><p>Called &#34;one of the most talented young writers on the American scene today&#34; by Paul Auster, Laird Hunt is the author of three previous, genre-bending novels: The Impossibly, The Exquisite, and Indiana, Indiana. A former press officer at the United Nations and current faculty member at the University of Denver, he lives in Boulder, Colorado.&#x201c;Hunt is an intellect and a great spinner of claustrophobic noir plots, and his erudite gumshoe yarn owes as much to George Perec and Gertrude Stein as it does to Paul Auster.&#x201d; <strong>&#x2015;The Believer</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Every once in a long while, you discover a novel unlike anything else you&#x2019;ve ever read. Laird Hunt&#x2019;s debut is one of them. Innovative, comic, bizarre and beautiful.&#x201d; <em><strong>&#x2015;Time Out New York</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;A fractured espionage story, John le Carr� � la Borges.&#x201d; <em><strong>&#x2015;The Stranger</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;For 200 pages, Hunt sustains an atmosphere of severe disorientation, packing his story with more curious and vaguely menacing strangers than a David Lynch movie. . . . The book&#x2019;s many layers and difficult questions make it an ideal candidate for an adventurous book club.&#x201d; <em><strong>&#x2015;Minneapolis Star Tribune</strong></em><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Impossibly</em> is one of the most exciting debut novels I have ever read. . . . While most Kafka comparisons are specious and overstated, Hunt&#x2019;s subtle humor, sophisticated intelligence and the graceful timbre of his prose place this novel firmly in the tradition of <em>The Castle</em>, as well as Nabokov&#x2019;s <em>The Eye</em> and Thomas Bernhard&#x2019;s <em>The Loser</em>. This is high praise indeed, but The <em>Impossibly</em> is a marvelous, wonderful novel.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;Review of Contemporary Fiction</em></strong><br><br>"[Laird Hunt] captures the tone of Paul Auster&#x2019;s <em>City of Glass</em> in the first few chapters, and he brings a decidedly Kafkaesque feel to the spy&#x2019;s early adventures.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hunt debuts with a stylish, if opaque, noir tale about a hit man who falls in love, takes a break, and incurs the wrath of his organization. . . . The mystery runs at all levels here, and the style and situation have appeal.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Impossibly</em>, Laird Hunt&#x2019;s first novel, is a challenging and inventive work, alternately chilling and humorous, that breaks new ground in the world of speculative fiction. Diffuse with noir tropes stripped of their origins, it leaves the reader with a map of the complicit mind trying to deal with perversity and adversity in a violent world.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;Rain Taxi Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;From the title to the last, dreamlike passage, Hunt&#x2019;s novel is a deliberate, sometimes striking conundrum, one with its origins deep in the heart of traditional genres (in particular, hardboiled detective fiction and international spy thrillers), but with ambitions that extend into knotty problems of narrative, language, and meaning.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;American Book Review</em></strong><br></p><h2>Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography</h2><p>A comprehensive portrait of the critically acclaimed playwright reveals Albee&#39;s struggle with alcoholism, his troubled personal life and unhappy childhood, and the genius that made him one of the most admired literary men of his generation. 17,500 first printing.</p><p>With his off-Broadway success <i>The Zoo Story</i> in 1960 and the Broadway smash <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> in 1962, Edward Albee announced himself as his generation's great American playwright. He had an unhappy childhood as the adopted son of wealthy suburbanites with no interest in his feelings or talents, and later immersed himself in the flourishing (but still closeted) New York gay scene of the 1950s. These seminal experiences gave Albee a sardonic, essentially bleak view of human relations that suited the questioning spirit of the '60s, as did his plays' absurdist tone and often experimental techniques. Alcoholism and bad reviews plagued him through much of the 1970s and '80s, but he emerged triumphant and sober in 1994 with the play <i>Three Tall Women</i>, which marked his mature understanding of his mother's life and won him a third Pulitzer Prize. Mel Gussow observed much of this personal and professional journey as a theater critic and an acquaintance; his book is a traditional biography based on research and interviews--with colleagues and friends as well as Albee himself--that also judiciously uses the author's firsthand experiences. (A section about the playwright's drunken rudeness at a dinner party and subsequent apologetic letter to Gussow is particularly revealing.) Gussow limns his subject's life with candor, but without prurience, and lucidly conveys Albee's importance in the American theater. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Melvyn H. Gussow was an American theater critic, movie critic, and author who wrote for The New York Times for 35 years.</p><h2>Corduroy Gets a Pet</h2><p>One day Corduroy finds a wounded baby bird in his yard.

Good light reading for any studying the region. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Chosin Reservoir Campaign</h2><p>THE BREAKOUT of the 1st Marine Division from the Chosin Reservoir area will long be remembered as one of the inspiring epics of our history. It is also worthy of consideration as a campaign in the best tradition of American military annals. The ability of the Marines to fight their way through twelve Chinese divisions over a 78-mile mountain road in sub-zero weather cannot be explained by courage and endurance alone. It also owed to the high degree of professional forethought and skill as well as the &#34;uncommon valor&#34; expected of all Marines. A great deal of initiative was required of unit commanders, and tactics had to be improvised at times on the spur of the moment to meet unusual circumstances. But in the main, the victory was gained by firm discipline and adherence to time-tested military principles. Allowing for differences in arms, indeed, the Marines of 1950 used much the same fundamental tactics as those employed on mountain roads by Xenophon and his immortal Ten Thousand when they cut their way through Asiatic hordes to the Black Sea in the year 401 B. C. When the danger was greatest, the 1st Marine Division might have accepted an opportunity for air evacuation of troops after the destruction of weapons and supplies to keep them from falling into the enemy&#39;s hands. But there was never a moment&#39;s hesitation. The decision of the commander and the determination of all hands to co me out .fighting with all essential equipment were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Marine Corps. - From the Forward Note: Missing p. 340.</p><p></p><h2>The World Exists for Me 2</h2><p>Still lost in time, Sekai and Sovieul find themselves in the castle of France&#39;s General Gilles de Rais, a dear friend to Joan of Arc, who was burned at the stake before the general could save her.

But who is Gil-Martin? And what does he truly desire? The Gothic double or doppelganger is nowhere more powerfully imagined than in Confessions of a Justified Sinner, once called 'the greatest novel of Scotland'.

Her characters are heroic in ordinary ways - they talk, laugh, and think about the things that matter to them. They live normal, everyday lives yet remain awake and focused in their concern about the future, emanating wisdom, humor, disappointment, hope, and fear. These stories center upon an appropriately named character, Faith, who tells and listens to the stories of friends, neighbors, lovers, and strangers struggling to find hope and meaning in their sometimes shattered lives. As the story titles suggest, Faith's endless confidence in her friends and in the ordinary powers of "Listening" and in becoming a "Story Hearer" pave the way for radical transformation. In "Zagrowsky Tells," Faith runs into the old Jewish pharmacist whose drug store she and her friends once picketed because he refused to sell to black patrons. Now, years later, she listens to how the ordinary act of learning to love his half black, half-Jewish grandson has taught him to unlearn his racism. Throughout the collection, neighbors learn to listen to each other, husbands and lovers learn to hear women, women who are longtime friends and political allies validate each others lives, and strangers tell stories that need to be heard. For Grace Paley, these important ties of love, faith, and language are what create community. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Suzanne Sowinska</i>In the 17 short stories collected here, Paley writes with verbal economy and resonance, pithy insights, and warmth and humor. The themes are familiar: friendship, commitment, responsibility, love, political idealism and activism, children, the nuclear shadow. PW greatly enjoyed these tales, stating: " 'Somewhere for me perfection is flowering,' says a character in one of these stories.

You&#x2019;ll also learn that one of the world&#x2019;s greatest nuclear scientists became a physicist only because he chose the wrong line while registering for his college classes.&nbsp; You&#x2019;ll discover how Gone with the Wind, one of the most successful novels in publishing history, came about because Margaret Mitchell, laid up with an injury, had to give up her job and stay home.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Scooby Doo, the famous cartoon dog, got his name when chance when its creator heard Frank Sinatra singing the chorus for Strangers in the Night which contains the words &#x2018;Scooby-scooby-do&#x2019; and how the Russians arrived late for at one early Olympics because they forgot they were on a different calendar and that&nbsp; Coca-Cola&#x2019;s most famous advertisement, launched in 1971 was inspired by an unplanned all night layover at an Irish airport.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil Mason has amassed one of the country&#x2019;s largest private collections of cuttings and books chronicling the weird and the strange.&nbsp; He other books include <i>How George Washington Fleeced the Nation</i>.&nbsp; He lives in England.&nbsp;In this collection of historical anecdotes, author Mason illustrates how the smallest details can have far-reaching historical consequences-or at least that seems to be the idea; in execution, there is no commentary, causal connection or even source identification that legitimizes any of Mason's information (he's known as a massive collector of "cuttings and books chronicling the weird and the strange"), so while many stories are funny or remarkable, they're little better than gossip. Despite a repetitive format, Mason writes well, and readers looking for pithy historical trivia to share with friends will be satisfied. Aimed at a U.K. audience, Mason tends toward topics like British royalty and the nuances of cricket, but there's enough conversational ammunition here for a cocktail party on either side of the Atlantic. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Blending the work of other scientists with their own extensive research in orangutan behavior, Kaplan and Rogers give rare insight into the lives, and the plight, of these peaceful, intelligent creatures. They provide an amazing account of orangutan behaviors, from their remarkable mothering skills to their ways of communication. Interspersed throughout are charming tales of some of the orangutans the authors have met and befriended. The authors also discuss the uncertain fate of these gentle forest dwellers, whose jungle habitat is visibly dwindling day by day. Illustrated throughout, <i>The Orangutans</i> is the first book to focus entirely on these remarkable primates and their relationship to humans in the evolutionary tree.</p><p>Chimpanzees might be more like us genetically, but a close look at <i>The Orangutans</i> shows that our Asian cousins seem much more human. That look has been thoughtfully provided by Australian primatologists Gisela Kaplan and Lesley J. Rogers of the University of New England in New South Wales. Their book, based on their work in Sumatra and Borneo, the last wild habitats of the orangutan, is captivating, and it provides new insight into the past, present, and clouded future of orangutans. With sections on evolutionary speculation, behavioral observation, and a plea for assistance for their continued survival, the book makes a compelling case for our interest, based in both scientific and humanitarian concerns. Profuse illustrations show these apes at all ages and splendidly demonstrate their diversity; unlike most other animals, not all orangutans look alike to us. The writing is tight and at times urgent, with the burden of near-extinction always close to the surface of the authors' concern for the apes. Vivid expression of such emotions as depression and curiosity, coupled with a sometimes disturbing facial resemblance to us, makes orangutans difficult to ignore. Unfortunately, the rapid destruction of their rain-forest home may squeeze them out of existence before we can act to save them. Whether the 20,000 or so left will be enough to breed into the next century is still a mystery; we must hope that <i>The Orangutans</i> will never have to stand in for more direct knowledge. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Gisela Kaplan and Lesley J. Rogers are professors at the University of New England in New South Wales, Australia, and are active researchers of orangutans in Indonesia and Malaysia.

An avid scuba diver, ballroom dancer and mother of five, she still enjoys her south Florida home, but loves to travel as well, from locations such as Cairo, Egypt, to her own backyard, the Florida Keys. Reading, however, is the pastime she still loves best, and she is a member of many writing groups. She&#x2019;s currently the vice president of the Horror Writers&#x2019; Association, and she&#x2019;s also an active member of International Thriller Writers. She is very proud to be a Killerette in the Killer Thriller Band, along with many fellow novelists she greatly admires.<br><br>"Are you Dolley Madison? Or, like, Martha Washington or something?" one of the boys edging toward the front of Allison Leigh's tour asked. He was about nine or ten, still awkward, but obviously determined to create some havoc&#x2014;no doubt to avoid embarrassing himself in front of the few other teens and preteens on the tour.<br><br>A taller, older boy, maybe twelve, who might have been his brother, nudged him. "You idiot, they're both dead, and she's alive. And she's hot, buddy. She's way too hot even in that getup to be one of <em>those</em> old ladies." The second boy tried to look mature. He reminded Allison of a very young Adam Sandler. The boys were part of her tour, which included a mix of ages. Summer was just drawing to a close and families were still on vacation.<br><br>She heard someone behind her choke back laughter; it was Nathan Pierson, longtime board member for the nonprofit organization that now owned the Tarleton-Dandridge House. They'd had a meeting in the attic, where a small office was located. Cherry Addison, the remaining descendent of the Dandridge clan, had already moved on, spike heels clicking. Ethan Oxford, their eldest member, had politely made his way through the crowd. Nathan and Sarah Vining were the last of the four board members to leave the house.<br><br>Nathan grinned and winked at Allison as he approached. Sarah hurried to catch up with him. She was a wisp of a woman who had given herself frown lines worrying about the board's every move, while Nathan was the opposite, always certain things would work out. He was a slim and stately man in his forties, not exactly a father figure, more like a cool-uncle figure. And he was amused.<br><br>Ally shot him a warning glance, but he kept grinning as he stepped past her. When he looked back and winked again, she forced a smile to her lips and turned her attention back to the group.<br><br>"Well, thanks, I think," she told the boy who'd spoken. There was nothing like having a few young kids on the tour, giggling and not the least bit interested in the history of the Tarleton-Dandridge House&#x2014;or the nation, for that matter. They didn't want to be here and were going to be thorns in her side if she didn't do something quickly. Ghost tours were the answer in situations like this.<br><br>To most kids an old house just seemed stuffy and boring. She understood how they felt, even though she'd always been the odd kid out herself&#x2014;a history nerd, as Julian liked to call her. She was from Philadelphia; she'd gone to Boston for her bachelor and master's, and to New York for her doctorate, but she loved her own city almost as if it were a friend with whom she'd grown up. From the time she was little, she'd gaped at Independence Hall and marveled that she could stand in the same place where some of the greatest men in American history had stood.<br><br>She surveyed the crowd and concluded that the two boys were indeed brothers, dragged along on a historical jaunt by their parents, the attractive couple a few feet back.<br><br>"Actually, my name is Allison Leigh, and the person I'm dressed to portray is Lucy Tarleton. And," she added teasingly, "she's supposed to haunt the place, so I'd be careful if I were you." She took a step closer to the taller of the two brothers. "She wants you to know your history."<br><br>He grinned and struck a swaggering pose. "I wouldn't mind meeting up with a hot ghost," he said. "And I know all about her. Lucy Tarleton, that is. We went on a ghost tour last night! She was a <em>spy.</em> Like a Hairy Mata."<br><br>"Mata Hari!" his dad whispered, shaking his head in amusement but setting a hand on the boy's shoulders. "Sorry!" he murmured to Allison.<br><br>"It's fine," Allison assured him. She turned back to the boy. "Great, then you're in the know," she said gravely. "You could meet up with Lucy today. Or maybe the ghost of Lord Brian 'Beast' Bradley, who is said to have murdered several patriots in cold blood, among them Lucy Tarleton."<br><br>"Ghosts? Bring 'em on!" the boy shouted.<br><br>"Todd," his father chastised. "Keep it down."<br><br>"It's all right. Everyone loves historic ghost stories," Allison said. She did like kids and understood that they were going to be, well, kids. She just wished people would recognize the human toll of war and what history could teach them.<br><br>She stepped back to welcome her entire group of fifteen. "Good evening," she said loudly, "and welcome to the Tarleton-Dandridge House, here in historic Philadelphia!"<br><br>Trees swayed gently in the breeze, and the air had taken on a sweet chill that might have been the promise of rain or merely the slow descent from summer into fall. Dusk was coming, and with it, a soft fog. They hadn't shortened their hours at the mansion yet, but the last tour was usually out while there was still a glimmer of light in the sky.<br><br>Watching the sky and feeling the breeze, Allison Leigh thought she didn't mind the long days at all, even if she was tired tonight. Of course, a lot of what she did was by rote and she could do it in her sleep, but she was fascinated by history, and adored the old historic house where she worked as a guide when her teaching schedule allowed. Summers generally meant full-time guiding. She liked people, too, especially children and young adults, and valued the opportunity to show them where the fate of a nation had been decided and to discuss both the Colonial era and the Revolution itself.<br><br>On most busy days the other three guides did their share of the tours. Annette Fanning, a good friend as well as coworker, had left early, scheduled for a root canal. Jason Lawrence was leading the tour group just ahead, dressed in the manner of the British dandy, Lord Bradley, who'd resided in the house when the patriots had fled. Julian Mitchell, the fourth guide employed by the private nonprofit corporation that owned the house, had disappeared around lunchtime. He was an effective guide, but he was also running around auditioning with his band, and had a tendency to show up late or disappear early. With the last of the school-age crowd going through at the tail end of summer, his lack of responsibility was irritating, but this tour was it for the night&#x2014;and then she'd be ready to close up and go home. They all liked Julian; he was just driving them crazy.<br><br>"Watch out! A ghost's going to follow you home," a young man in the crowd whispered to the boys. He smiled, looking at the young woman with him, his wife or girlfriend, as if watching the boys because he might want a few of his own one day.<br><br>"I don't think ghosts follow you home," the younger of the two brothers said bravely. "I mean, they're supposed to haunt a <em>place,</em> right?"<br><br>"Maybe they <em>can</em> follow you home!" his brother teased. "They can go through walls, can't they?"<br><br>"Stop it!" the younger one said.<br><br>His brother made chicken sounds.<br><br>Allison clapped her hands to draw their attention back to the tour. "The Tarleton-Dandridge House is open to help you understand the Revolutionary War and the occupation of Philadelphia, not to send ghosts home with anyone," she announced. "So, we'll start with a brief history, although I'm sure you know most of this. Philadelphia was the first capital of the United States. And the Declaration of Independence was written and signed here. But by that time, shots had been fired in Boston&#x2014;and the British navy was occupying Staten Island. What you may not realize is that the First Continental Congress worked here before they decided on independence. At first, they were seeking a means to achieve...can someone tell me?"<br><br>Oddly enough, it was her swaggering young beau, the older brother, who raised his hand. "No taxation without representation!" he said.<br><br>"Very good. So, since it looked like the royal foot was coming down to punish the colonies for their revolt against taxes&#x2014;and they'd already risked being hanged for protesting lack of representation, the next step was to go all the way. Make the stakes worth the consequences, in other words. But it wasn't the citizens of Philadelphia who were eager for war, or at least not all of them. Remember, this area was settled by the Quaker William Penn. He granted the city its charter. Those who believe in the Quaker creed are and have always been antiwar and antiviolence, but by the time of the American Revolution, this was a city of about thirty thousand, all mixed in their beliefs and backgrounds."<br><br>"Yeah! They were ready to fight for freedom!" the older boy said.<br><br>She nodded. "By then the colonies had formed the Second Continental Congress, so a fight for independence it became. But Philadelphia would pay the price. The British wanted the capital. According to their logic, if you took the capital, the rest of the upstarts would fall apart and surrender. However, General George Washington had learned from his Indian wars, and he waged a different kind of warfare. Still, we lost many battles and, as I said, Philadelphia and her residents paid a heavy toll."<br><br>She seemed to have won over the boys, which pleased her, and they were looking at her intently now rather than gawking.<br><br>"Gentlemen, if you will?" she asked the two brothers.<br><br>They actually seemed nervous as she walked back to the podium by the gate. She took out two mock Colonial muskets and gave them to the boys. The male guides carried exceptionally accurate reproduction muskets, but to entertain young adults before entering the house, the guides used mock-up plastic muskets.<br><br>"Now, how would you feel if I put you twenty feet apart and told you to shoot at each other? Do you think it would make a lot of sense?"<br><br>"You shoot enough and.I guess we could hit each other," the taller boy said. "Eventually."<br><br>"Maybe," the younger brother added.<br><br>She nodded. "Muskets of the day weren't great on aim. For every shot, a man had to load his powder, tamp it down and hope the enemy wasn't upon him before he could fire again. What are your names?" she asked the boys.<br><br>The younger brother was Jimmy, she discovered, and the older one was Todd. She had them perform and they followed her instructions, demonstrating a manner of fighting in which they walked toward each other, and then another manner, in which one of them hid behind a tree.<br><br>"George Washington had learned well, don't you think? He knew the British could outman, outpower and outdiscipline him. So if they wanted the city, he'd take to the countryside. Back in the 1770s, for about a hundred miles all around Philadelphia, there was nothing but wilderness. Washington could abandon the city, let the British move in for a while, and the Revolutionary government could keep trying to sway the French to join us, which happened in 1778. And the British knew they could become locked in, trapped. So they in turn had to abandon the city."<br><br>Allison checked the little watch she wore on a chain around her neck, and saw that she'd given Jason plenty of time to take his group through.<br><br>"Shall we enter the house?" she said, opening the gate that led up to the handsome brick house.<br><br>"Let's go!" Todd blurted out.<br><br>She arched a brow at him. He grinned, and she smiled back.<br><br>As she led her group into the small but beautifully manicured yard, Allison told them, "The house was built in 1752 of brick and stone, in what was known as the Flemish style, with alternating longer and shorter bricks. It was built for Lucy Tarleton's father, an Irish immigrant who rose to success and attained great riches as a merchant&#x2014;and had no love for the British King George."<br><br>"Mad King George!" Jimmy said.<br><br>"Yes, so they called him." Allison paused on the porch, waiting for the stragglers to catch up.<br><br>"King George never set foot here, of course," she went on. "The days of kings leading their men into battle were long gone. But as for King George's war," Allison said, "there were two English brothers in control of the war effort here&#x2014;Admiral Richard Howe on the water and General William Howe on land. One thing they hoped, of course, was that many citizens would be loyal to Britain and start coming out of the woodwork when they arrived."<br><br>"And there <em>were</em> citizens loyal to Great Britain, right?" Jimmy asked.<br><br>"Yep. There were citizens loyal to Great Britain, although many moved to Canada&#x2014;the United Empire Loyalists&#x2014;when the war began. But this city was a prize to the British, harder to obtain than they'd expected."<br><br>"The rivers weren't deep enough for the Royal navy!" Todd said. "I know that because we've been on so many history tours already!"<br><br>"Exactly," Allison agreed. "And there were numerous unseen obstacles under the water. It was difficult!<br><br>But eventually they made their way here." She continued the story she'd told so many times before. "Philadelphia fell to the British, and was held by them from September 26, 1777, through June 18, 1778. General Washington deprived them of greater victory by seeing that the city was abandoned and the Continental Congress moved to New York City. The British set up a puppet government in Philadelphia for that nine-month period. Meanwhile, the British soldiers enjoyed the warmth and comfort of some of these splendid homes, while Washington's men froze at Valley Forge. And so here, at this beautiful mansion, Lucy Tarleton stayed behind, pretending to be loyal to the Crown, throwing parties, and even feigning a romance with Lord Brian Bradley&#x2014;soon to be known as 'Beast' Bradley, and soon to execute&#x2014;without trial or king's command&#x2014;the lovely patriot, Lucy Tarleton. Lucy was indeed passing British secrets to General Washington down in Valley Forge. She was passionate about her cause and she was to die for her efforts, in a rare but tragically vindictive incident. Follow me."<br><br>The front door led through a tiny mudroom with cut-glass windows and then into a grand foyer. "In the city, you'll find that many businesses were on the first floors of what are now historic buildings, while the living quarters were upstairs. But here, a servant would greet guests in the foyer, and determine where they'd go. Mr. Tarleton's study was to your right, while the salon was the first room to your left," she said, gesturing in those directions. "The kitchen is still a separate house out back, which prevented a cooking fire from reaching the main house. Beyond the salon is the dining room, and it gave the servants easy access to the kitchen. The left side of the house as you face me was the entertainment area, you might say, and to your right were the family rooms. In back of the study is the ladies' parlor, and behind that, the music room. You'll see an exquisite harpsichord there that actually belonged to the Tarleton family. Upstairs, there are five bedrooms and the attic, which contained storage space and rooms for the servants. The Tarletons had five household servants who lived in the main house and a number of gardeners and grooms who lived over the carriage house, which is also preserved."<br><br>"Servants! I could use a few!" the boys' mother said, ruffling her younger son's hair.<br><br></p><h2>Heads You Win</h2><p>&#39;The master storyteller returns with a nail-biter every bit as good as Kane and Abel - utterly enthralling&#39; - Joanna Lumley Heads You Win is the incredible and thrilling novel by the master storyteller and bestselling author of the Clifton Chronicles and Kane and Abel, Jeffrey Archer.

Oberman reveals the practical challenges raised by a thriving black market in abortion drugs, as well as the legal challenges to law enforcement. She describes a system in which doctors and lawyers collaborate in order to identify and prosecute those suspected of abortion-related crimes, and the troubling results of such collaboration: mistaken diagnoses, selective enforcement, and wrongful convictions.<br><br>Equipped with this understanding, Oberman turns her attention to the United States, where the battle over abortion is fought almost exclusively in legislatures and courtrooms. Beginning in Oklahoma, one of the most pro-life states, and through interviews with current and former legislators and activists, she shows how Americans voice their moral opposition to abortion by supporting laws that would restrict it. In this America, the law is more a symbol than a plan.<br><br>Oberman challenges this vision of the law by considering the practical impact of legislation and policies governing both motherhood and abortion. Using stories gathered from crisis pregnancy centers and abortion clinics, she unmasks the ways in which the law already shapes women&#x2019;s responses to unplanned pregnancy, generating incentives or penalties, nudging pregnant women in one direction or another.<br><br>In an era in which every election cycle features a pitched battle over abortion&#x2019;s legality, Oberman uses her research to expose the limited ways in which making abortion a crime matters. Her insight into the practical consequences that will ensue if states are permitted to criminalize abortion calls attention to the na�ve and misguided nature of contemporary struggles over abortion&#x2019;s legality.<br><br>A fresh look at the battle over abortion law, <i>Her Body, Our Laws</i> is an invitation to those on all sides of the issue to move beyond the incomplete discourse about legality by understanding how the law actually matters.</p><p><b>Michelle Oberman</b> is the Katharine and George Alexander Professor of Law at Santa Clara University School of Law and an internationally recognized scholar on the legal and ethical issues surrounding adolescence, pregnancy, and motherhood. She works at the intersection of public health and criminal law, focusing on domestic and international issues affecting women&#x2019;s reproductive health.

This beautifully written and thought-provoking book offers the reader a novel way to consider the endless abortion conflict in the United States and elsewhere.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Carole Joffe, author of <i>Dispatches from the Abortion Wars: The Costs of Fanaticism to Doctors, Patients, and the Rest of Us</i><br><br>&#x201c;Oberman shows us that that in the midst of war, there is always space for listening. In her global journey through abortion laws and ideology, she brings us back to what really matters: sharing stories that help us recognize our common humanity. In our time of increasing polarization and politicization, <i>Her Body, Our Laws</i> demands a new path forward on abortion, one rooted in the difficult conversations we need to help us connect across our differences.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Aspen Baker, author of <i>Pro-Voice: How to Keep Listening When the World Wants a Fight</i> and founder of Exhale<br><br>&#x201c;This is a splendid and important book. Oberman brings a legal scholar&#x2019;s attention to analysis of the abortion wars, along with a powerful gift for telling the stories of those intimately involved. In so doing, she illuminates not only what is at stake in our debates about abortion law but also what is missing from them.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Debra Satz, the Marta Sutton Weeks Professor of Philosophy, Stanford University<br><br>&#x201c;Oberman lays bare the messy and paradoxical realities of abortion that churn beneath the reductive debate over its legality. Stories gathered across borders and decades depict lofty ideals of morality and choice trampled by concrete oppressive conditions far more compelling than the letter of the law. As she astutely observes, abortion&#x2019;s legal status matters little to those robbed by structural inequalities of dignity and volition in their reproductive experiences.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jill E.

This deluxe edition of Sylvester and the Magic Pebble truly recaptures that magic for a whole new generation of readers.</p></p><p>Imagine all the happiness and wealth you could achieve if you found a magic pebble that granted your every wish! Sylvester Duncan, an unassuming donkey who collects pebbles "of unusual shape and color," experiences just such a lucky find. But before he can make all his wishes come true, the young donkey unexpectedly encounters a mean-looking lion. Startled, Sylvester wishes he were a rock, but in mineral form he can no longer hold the pebble, and thus cannot wish himself back to his equine trappings. His parents, thinking he has disappeared, are at first frantic, then miserable, and then plunge into donkey ennui. Meanwhile, Sylvester is gravely depressed, but tries to get used to being a rock.<p> In 1970, William Steig won the Caldecott Medal for <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>--the first of his many Newbery and Caldecott honors. In this donkey's tale, Steig imbues his characteristically simple illustrations of animals sporting human garb with evocative, irresistible, and heartbreakingly vivid emotions. The text is straightforward and the dialogue remarkably touching. Children will feel deeply for Sylvester and his parents, all wishing for the impossible--that the family will one day be reunited. Sylvester's sweet story is one that endures, reminding us all that sometimes what we have is all we really need. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>On a rainy day, Sylvester finds a magic pebble that can make wishes come true.

Broadcast journalism came of age in that crisis, and KRLD News earned the profession&#39;s highest honor for its on-the-scene reporting. The writers worked in support of Dan Rather and Walter Cronkite as they reported the first on-camera murder and initiated the first continuous live coverage. Reporters who were part of this watershed in broadcast journalism have had four decades to consider events that were too fast and stunning to allow emotional detachment or reflection. They have never written their account of what happened on the scene in Dallas in 1963 until this book, and no other group had quite the behind-the-scene perspectives these four shared.</p><p>The authors of this riveting first-person account, Bob Huffaker, Bill Mercer, George Phenix, and Wes Wise, were reporters for the Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD Radio-TV News, one of America&#x2019;s largest and best equipped news organizations. These journalists covered Texas and worked with Dan Rather, Walter Cronkite, and the rest of CBS News in bringing area news to the nation. When covering JFK&#x2019;s Dallas visit suddenly evolved into reporting a worldwide tragedy, they kept as calm as possible, to encourage the world to remain sane. <p>At the epicenter of that crisis KRLD News earned the nation&#x2019;s highest honor for its on-the-scene reporting, presented by the Radio Television News Directors Association, which recognized the KRLD News staff&#x2019;s reaction to the sudden tragedy: </p><p>"KRLD deserves the highest praise for the manner in which its personnel moved without a moment of hesitation from what was to have been normal coverage of the arrival, presentation and departure of the President, into fascinating, elaborate, complete and deeply detailed coverage at the local level of what has to be easily the story of our modern lives."</p>Here, finally, is the view from the street about November 22, 1963. This reporters&#39; account of the Kennedy assassination brings to full focus the personal anguish as well as the professional pressure endured that day by those who could not take the time to cry.

From Indians and early explorers, to colonists, naturalists, loggers, industrialists, and beyond, from presidents, poets, and artists, including Jefferson, Lincoln, Carter, Thoreau, Frost, Homer, Andrew Wyeth, and many more, the story of our once mighty, towering native chestnut tree is a lesson for our times.

It is the story of the dedicated few who refused who give up: the fearless plant explorer who tracked down the blight in war-torn China, the plant pathologists and geneticists who labored long and valiantly to understand the blight and find a way to thwart it. It is also a story of hope, of small but vital triumphs, as the secrets of the American chestnut and its deadly nemesis are gradually revealed. <br><br>Copublished with The American Chestnut Foundation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the re-establishment of the American chestnut tree to its natural range.</p><p>� Chestnut scenes from artists such as Winslow Homer, Seneca Ernie Smith, Andrew Wyeth, Charles Burchfield, and a generous selection of seldom-seen photographs of American chestnut throughout its history. � &#x201c;Chestnuts in my Life&#x201d; by Jimmy Carter. � Poems by Wendell Berry and Robert Frost. � Chestnut folklore and anecdotes, including reminiscences from southern Appalachia to New England, along with historical newspaper chronicles of the tree before, during, and after the blight.� Chestnut reflections by plant geneticist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Borlaug, father of the &#x201c;Green Revolution.&#x201d; � Colorful accounts of railroads and locomotives that logged mammoth chestnut trees in Appalachia, by Les Line, longtime editor of Audubon magazine. � Chestnut recollections and inspirations from Bill Owens, Dolly Parton's uncle, a Tennessee mountain man, musician, and champion of the tree.� Excerpts from best-selling author Barbara Kingsolver's Prodigal Summer, about a curmudgeonly chestnut breeder and his cantankerous rural Virginia neighbor.Chestnuts in my Life by Jimmy Carter. - Poems by Wendell Berry and Robert Frost. - Chestnut folklore and anecdotes, including reminiscences from <br>southern Appalachia to New England, along with historical newspaper chronicles of the tree before, during, and after the blight. - Chestnut reflections by plant geneticist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Borlaug, father of the Green Revolution. -<br>Colorful accounts of railroads and locomotives that logged mammoth chestnut trees in Appalachia, by Les Line, longtime editor of Audubon magazine. -<br>Chestnut recollections and inspirations from Bill Owens, Dolly Parton s uncle, a Tennessee mountain man, musician, and champion of the tree. - Excerpts from best-selling author Barbara Kingsolver s Prodigal <br>Summer, about a curmudgeonly chestnut breeder and his cantankerous rural Virginia neighbor. <br>Chestnut scenes from artists such as Winslow Homer, Seneca Ernie Smith, Andrew Wyeth, Charles Burchfield, and a generous selection of seldom-seen photographs of American chestnut throughout its history.</p><h2>Quixote: The Novel and the World</h2><p><p><strong>A groundbreaking cultural history of the most influential, most frequently translated, and most imitated novel in the world.</strong></p><p>The year 2015 marks the four hundredth anniversary of the publication of the complete <em>Don Quixote of La Mancha</em>&#x2015;an ageless masterpiece that has proven unusually fertile and endlessly adaptable. Flaubert was inspired to turn Emma Bovary into &#x201c;a knight in skirts.&#x201d; Freud studied Quixote&#x2019;s psyche. Mark Twain was fascinated by it, as were Kafka, Picasso, Nabokov, Borges, and Orson Welles.

Only to the white man was nature a &#39;wilderness&#39; and only to him was the land &#39;infested&#39; with &#39;wild&#39; animals and &#39;savage&#39; people. To us it was tame. Earth was boutiful and we were surrounded with the blessings of the Great Mystery. Not until the hairy man from the east came and with brutal frenzy heaped injustices upon us and the families we loved was it &#39;wild&#39; for us, it was that for us the &#39;Wild West&#39; began.&#34; TOUCH THE EARTH is a selection of statements and writings by North American Indians, chosen to illuminate the course of Indian history and the abiding values of Indian life.

Mystified at first by the white man&#39;s ways, the Indian tone guves way first to anger, then desperation and, finally hopelessness.

Winner of the 1980 New Zealand Wattie Book of the Year Award, it is considered a classic work of Pacific literature.|An epic spanning three generations, &#39;Leaves of the Banyan Tree&#39; tells the story of a family and community in Western Samoa, exploring on a grand scale such universal themes as greed, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, and revenge.This novel by the Samoan-born Wendt (The Birth and Death of the Miracle Man, 1986, etc.), first published in 1979, is a family saga that contrasts three generations of Western Samoans as a way of exploring the effects of colonialism before and after the country's independence from New Zealand. Tauilopepe, the grandfather, who lives on his family's plantation in a farming village, wages a 30-year struggle in the face of European encroachment to extend his family's lands and acquire wealth, power, and prestige. ``God, Money, and Success'' is his credo. His rebellious son, Pepe, winds up doing hard labor after being expelled from the town school and helping to torch a Protestant church hall ``because God does not live in it.'' He soon dies of tuberculosis and leaves behind a son, Lalolagi, who is taken away from his mother by Tauilopepe and sent to a New Zealand boarding school where he is groomed for success and consequently rejects the Samoan language in favor of English. Later, Lalolagi falls in with businessmen and con men of Samoan and European backgrounds, apparently newly united in their determination to exploit the independent country's resources. This book dramatically illustrates the dilemma of a family caught between holding onto old values as everything changes around them and compromising those values in order to survive. But while the reasons for Tauilopepe's single-minded behavior are clear and comprehensible from a historical perspective, they are, narratively, less convincing: His character and emotional motivation aren't fully explored. Disappointingly, women don't have a voice in this story, which is told from male points of view. And the glossary is not as complete as it could be for those unfamiliar with Samoan terms. These flaws combine to make this a less-than-satisfying read. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When Captain Robert FitzRoy, the twenty-six-year-old captain of the H.M.S. <em>Beagle</em>, set out for Tierra del Fuego in the fall of 1831, he invited a young naturalist to accompany him. That twenty-two-year-old gentleman was Charles Darwin, and perhaps no single voyage in history had a greater impact on how we would come to understand the world -- in both religious and scientific terms.</p><p>When the <em>Beagle</em>'s first captain committed suicide while at sea in 1828, he was replaced by a young naval officer of a new mold. Robert FitzRoy was the most brilliant and scientific sea captain of his age. He used the <em>Beagle</em>, a survey vessel, as a laboratory for the new field of the natural sciences. But his plan to bring four "savages" home to England to civilize them as Christian gentlefolk backfired when scandal loomed over their sexual misbehavior at the Walthamstow Infants School. FitzRoy needed to get them out of England fast, and thus was born the second and most famous voyage of the <em>Beagle</em>.</p><p>FitzRoy feared the loneliness of another long voyage -- with madness in his own family, he was haunted by the fate of the <em>Beagle</em>'s previous captain -- so for company he took with him the young amateur naturalist Charles Darwin. Like FitzRoy, Darwin believed, at the beginning of the voyage, in the absolute word of the Bible and the story of man's creation. The two men spent five years circling the globe together, but by the end of their voyage they had reached startlingly different conclusions about the origins of the natural world.</p><p>In naval terms, the voyage was a stunning scientific success. But FitzRoy, a fanatical Christian, was horrified by the heretical theories Darwin began to develop. As these began to influence the profoundest levels of religious and scientific thinking in the nineteenth century, FitzRoy's knowledge that he had provided Darwin with the vehicle for his sacrilegious ideas propelled him down an irrevocable path to suicide.</p><p>This true story -- part biography, part sea drama, and a subtle study of one of the defining moments in the history of science -- reads like the finest historical fiction. It is a chronicle of the remarkable chain of events without which Darwin would most likely have lived and died an obscure English country parson with a fondness for collecting beetles.</p></p><p><p>Peter Nichols is the author of the national bestseller <em>A Voyage for Madmen</em> and two other books, <em>Sea Change: Alone Across the Atlantic in a Wooden Boat</em>, a memoir, and the novel <em>Voyage to the North Star</em>. He has taught creative writing at NYU in Paris and Georgetown University, and presently teaches at Bowdoin College. He is lives in Maine with his wife and son.</p>Readers familiar with how Darwin developed his theory of evolution will recognize the HMS Beagle as the ship that took him on his research expedition, but that's probably the extent of their knowledge of the vessel. Nichols (A Voyage for Madmen, etc.) fills in the gaps with this biography of Robert FitzRoy, the Beagle's second captain. In 1828, FitzRoy took command after the first captain went mad and killed himself. Picking up where his predecessor left off charting the waters off South America, FitzRoy captured several natives and brought them back to England so they could be taught the ways of Western civilization. Complications required their immediate return, and it was FitzRoy's request for a traveling companion of equal social status on this hastily planned journey that resulted in Darwin's coming aboard. Nichols, who has taught creative writing at Georgetown and NYU, picks his narrative details well, fleshing out FitzRoy's personality and his shifting relationship with Darwin (though initially friendly, the captain came to violently reject his traveling companion's scientific conclusions). The bulk of the story is devoted to FitzRoy's two missions for the Royal Navy, both of which made him a well-known figure in England. The final chapters trace his eventual downfall, though emphasizing the "dark fate" in the subtitle is rather misleading. Though the author's enthusiasm for his subject can lead to hyperbole, it'll prove hard not to share his fascination with how FitzRoy's naval career inadvertently set off a scientific controversy still flaring to this day. 8 illus.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Klotsvog (Russian Library)</h2><p><i>Klotsvog</i> is a novel about being Jewish in the Soviet Union and the historical trauma of World War II&#x2015;and it&#x2019;s a novel about the petty dramas and demons of one strikingly vain woman. Maya Abramovna Klotsvog has had quite a life, and she wants you to know all about it. Selfish, garrulous, and thoroughly entertaining, she tells us where she came from, who she didn&#x2019;t get along with, and what became of all her husbands and lovers.<br><br>In <i>Klotsvog</i>, Margarita Khemlin creates a first-person narrator who is both deeply self-absorbed and deeply compelling. From Maya&#x2019;s perspective, Khemlin unfurls a retelling of the Soviet Jewish experience that integrates the historical and the personal into her protagonist&#x2019;s vividly drawn inner and outer lives. Maya&#x2019;s life story flows as a long monologue, told in unfussy language dense with Khemlin&#x2019;s magnificently manipulated Soviet clich�s and matter-of-fact descriptions of Soviet life. Born in a center of Jewish culture in Ukraine, she spent the war in evacuation in Kazakhstan. She has few friends but has had several husbands, and her relationships with her relatives are strained at best. The war looms over <i>Klotsvog</i>, and the trauma runs deep, as do the ambiguities and ambivalences of Jewish identity. Lisa Hayden&#x2019;s masterful translation brings this gripping character study full of dark, sly humor and new perspectives on Jewish heritage and survival to an English-speaking audience.</p><p>Margarita Khemlin (1960&#x2013;2015) was born in Chernigov, Ukraine, and lived in Moscow. Her works were shortlisted for the Russian Booker Prize and the Big Book Prize. Her books include <i>The Investigator </i>(2015).<br><br>Lisa C. Hayden has translated works from Russian including Eugene Vodolazkin&#x2019;s <i>The Aviator</i>, <i>Solovyov and Larionov</i>, and <i>Laurus</i>. She blogs at Lizok&#x2019;s Bookshelf, focusing on contemporary Russian fiction.<br><br>Lara Vapnyar is a novelist whose most recent book is <i>Still Here</i>.Maya Abramovna Klotsvog is materialistic and manipulative. She&#x2019;s a kind of Soviet Becky Sharp, in a 1950s version of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, trying to survive in a hostile world. . . . In giving voice to this complex, wounded character, Khemlin invites us to empathize even as we judge and to better understand our own common, terrified, irrational humanity. (Phoebe Taplin <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>In many ways, Khemlin has written the picaresque novel for the Soviet Era. . . . Maya Klotsvog&#x2019;s life recalls a Jew�ish adage men�tioned in the novel, 'The house is burn�ing but the clock still keeps time.' We see a life that moves forward even while it smolders. Her survival is triumphant, as is this novel. (Austin Sanchez-Moran <i>Jewish Book Council</i>)<br><br>Khemlin has created an unforgettable character and opened a window onto a world more people should know about. (Marissa Moss <i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>Funny and enraging, moving and deeply felt. . . . A subtle, nuanced take on one apparently selfish woman and the difficult choices she makes. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br><i>Klotsvog</i> is a story of everyday darkness told by the ultimate unreliable narrator. Armed with endless justifications, Maya&#x2019;s compelled by the power of what she sheds, whether it&#x2019;s her Jewish heritage, her Ukrainian roots, her failed relationships, or her self-awareness. Yet part of what makes her confusing and compelling is the core of practical ambition, survivorship, and threat that lies beneath her vanity. As Maya vibrates on a frequency between ruthless self-determination and charming narcissism, <i>Klotsvog</i> infects its audience with a compulsion to determine which dominates. (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>This singular novel is simultaneously an intimate portrait of a woman who does not see the consequences of her actions and an exploration of the corrosive effects of anti-Semitism on individuals and society. Set after World War II, it feels eerily timely. A most necessary read. (Aviya Kushner, author of <i>The Grammar of God</i> and language columnist at <i>The Forward</i>)<br><br>Through the defensive, abject, yet utterly seductive voice of its untrustworthy narrator, <i>Klotsvog </i>entices us to enter the suspect schemes and shameless denials that characterize the dailiness of Soviet Jewish lives. As a novel, it is so utterly honest, it will make you cringe. (Marianne Hirsch, author of <i>The Generation of Postmemory: Writing and Visual Culture After the Holocaust</i>)<br><br>Like some of her predecessors&#x2015;Jewish writers born in small Ukrainian towns&#x2015;the talented Margarita Khemlin infused the lives of her characters with grand ambitions and luminous failures. A valuable and welcome addition to the growing body of Jewish-Russian literature in English translation. (Maxim D. Shrayer, author of <i>A Russian Immigrant</i> and editor of <i>Voices of Jewish-Russian Literature</i>)<br><br>Truly a masterpiece of Russian fiction.

However, Fenfang is ill-prepared for what greets her: a Communist regime that has outworn its welcome, a city under rampant destruction and slap-dash development, and a sexist attitude seemingly more in keeping with her peasant upbringing than the country&#x2019;s progressive capital. Yet Fenfang is determined to live a modern life. With courage and purpose, she forges ahead, and soon lands a job as a film extra. While playing roles like <i>woman-walking-over-the bridge</i> and <i>waitress-wiping-a-table</i> help her eke out a meager living, Fenfang comes under the spell of two unsuitable young men, keeps her cupboard stocked with UFO noodles, and after mastering the fever and tumult of the city, ultimately finds her true independence in the one place she never expected.<br><br>At once wry and moving, <i>Twenty Fragments of a Ravenous Youth </i>gives us a clear-eyed glimpse into the precarious and fragile state of China&#x2019;s new identity and asserts Xiaolu Guo as her generation&#x2019;s voice of modern China.</p></p><p><p>XIAOLU GUO was born in a fishing village in southern China.

At least, that's when I decided it began. That was when I started to think that all those shiny things in life--some of them might possibly be for me.<br><br>If you think twenty-one sounds a bit late for youth to start, just think about the average Chinese peasant, who leaps straight from childhood to middle age with nothing in between. If I was going to miss out on anything, it was middle age. Be young or die. That was my plan.<br><br>Anyway, when I was twenty-one, my life changed just by filling out this application form. Before then, I was just an ignorant country girl who didn't know how to do anything except dig up sweet potatoes, clean toilets and pull levers in a factory. Okay, I'd been in Beijing a few years, but I was still a peasant.<br><br>My momentous transformation took place at the Beijing Film Studios. It was a boiling hot afternoon. The walls of the recruitment office were still messy with the slogans of Chairman Mao: "Serve the People!" Green-headed flies buzzed over a lunchbox of leftover noodles. Behind the lunchbox, a hero of the people was dozing away on his chair. He was supposed to be supervising the registration of film extras. It had obviously worn him out. He paid no attention to us. We were flies too.<br><br>There were three other girls filling out forms. They looked much cooler than me: dyed hair, tattooed arms, fake leather handbags, jeans with holes, the whole lot. They chatted and giggled like geese. But I could tell that, underneath their fully armed appearance, they were just brown-skinned peasant girls from yellow sandy provinces, like me.<br><br>I picked up a pen from the desk, a Hero fountain pen. Only old communists still use Hero pens. I've never liked them. They're lousy. As I wrote, the Hero started to leak. The ink ruined my application form. My fingers turned black, and my palm too. My mother used to say a black palm would cause your house to catch fire. So I started to worry my inky palm would bring me bad luck.<br><br>The office was totally full of application forms. CVs were piled from floor to ceiling. Dust hung in the air like the milky-way. As I attached my photo to the top-right-hand corner of the sheet, the hero of the people dozing behind the lunchbox woke up. The first thing he did, he stood up and swung a fly-swatter around his lunch to exterminate the flies. The three girls stopped filling out their forms and looked frightened by this sudden violence. Bam, one fly. Bam, a second. He sat down again, two dead bodies on the desk in front of him.<br><br>I handed over my fifteen-Yuan registration fee. Without looking at me, he took a bunch of keys from his belt and, leaning forward, opened an old squeaky drawer. He found a big stamp, adjusted some numbers, and pressed it into a red ink pad. Then he raised his arm and slammed it down on my form. Extra No. 6787.<br><br>So, I was the 6,787th person in Beijing wanting a job in the film and TV industry. Between me and a role stood 6,786 other people--young and beautiful, old and ugly. I felt the competition, but compared with the 1.5 billion people in China, 6,786 wasn't such a daunting number. It was only the population of my village. I felt an urge to conquer this new village.<br><br>Still without looking at me, the fly-swatting hero of the people started to study my photo on the stained form.<br><br>"Not bad, young girl. Compared to other parts of your face, your forehead has something: it's nearly as broad as Tiananmen Square. And your jaw's not bad, either. It will bring you good fortune, believe me. Square jaws do. As for your earlobes--fat as Buddha's. The fatter the luckier, did you know that? Mmm . . . you're not that ugly. You can't imagine how many ugly people come to this place every day. I don't get it. Don't they look at themselves in the mirror first?"<br><br>I listened patiently and then thanked him. Leaving Extras No. 6788, 6789, 6790 behind, I walked back out into the street. The noon sun hit the top of my head so heavily it immediately fried my hair. The summer heat and dust of the city rose up from the concrete pavement. I was caught in the middle of this heat fight. I almost fainted in the noisy street. Maybe I really fainted, I can't remember, it doesn't matter anyway. The important thing was: I had been given a number. From this day on I would never again live like a forgotten sweet potato under the dark soil. Never.<br><b>fragment 2</b><br><br><b>HOW FENFANG, BEWILDERED, PUT DOWN ROOTS<br>IN BEIJING</b><br><br>My first night in Beijing. A seventeen-year-old who thought that drinking a can of ice-cold Coke was the greatest thing ever. I lugged my suitcase from one hotel to the next. Hotels weren't for peasants, I knew that. So what was I doing? Even if I'd had pockets full of Yuan, they wouldn't have let me in. Each time I passed a hotel, the doorman's face confirmed that fact. It was obvious what those bastards were thinking: what are you doing here, peasant? I needed to find a cheap place instead, but all the cut-price hostels were in basements and I wasn't so crazy about spending my first night underground. Beijing was a brave new world for me, bright even at night. I wanted to rub up against it.<br><br>I ended up in the east of the city, near Bei He Yan, a Hutong area. The Hutongs. Long, thin alleys bordered by low, grey houses surrounding noisy, crammed courtyards. Countless alleys packed with countless homes where countless families lived. These old-time Beijing residents thought they were the "Citizens of the Emperor." They didn't seem so noble to me.<br><br>I sat by the road on my suitcase. Two old men were squatting near me, drinking tea and playing chess. They looked as though they'd been there for hours, or weeks, or maybe even centuries. After a while I realized I felt really hungry. Not my usual kind of hunger, the low grumble that begins in my belly the moment I get up and doesn't stop, however much I eat. This was serious hunger--the kind when you've been on a train for three days without anything proper to eat. I got up and bought a baked potato from a roadside vendor. Then I sat down again. In the sunset, the street lamps started to glow. One by one small lights illuminated the windows. There were no people about. Even the chess players had gone. I started to worry. I worried about my future, or more precisely, about my tomorrow. I got anxious.<br><br>Through the open curtains of a nearby window, a girl and her mother were arguing. Shadows flickered in the room as their voices grew louder and louder, shouting vehement but indistinguishable words. I couldn't believe a mother and her daughter could have so much to say to each other. They must be very close. In my family, no one talked. My father never talked to my mother, my parents never talked to my grandmother, and none of them ever talked to me. In my village, people lived like insects, like worms, like slugs hanging on the back door of the house. There wasn't much to talk about. I felt drawn to this house and its loud voices. I could sense something was going to happen between this house and me.<br><br>Suddenly the door was flung open and the young girl ran out, chased by her mother. It all happened very quickly. A van was hurtling past. The fleeing girl jumped into the road, her mother close behind. My half-eaten potato rolled out of my hand on to the ground. Under the van, the two dismantled bodies were crushed, along with my dead potato. There was an unbearable scream of brakes and the driver leapt out of his van. He pulled the mother and daughter into the back and, without saying anything or looking at me, he drove off. I blinked. When I looked again I saw that there was only a bit of blood on the pavement, glistening in the street lights.<br><br>I sat in that same spot for a long time, not knowing what to do with my first night in a big city. There was no one else around. The door the mother and daughter had run out of was still open, the light still on. No one had gone in. No ghosts had come out. After half an hour, I decided to look inside.<br><br>On the wall, there was an old-fashioned clock--the kind with a woodpecker which taps out the hour with its beak--and a world-city calendar showing that famous red bridge in San Francisco. A cup of green tea sat on the table. I touched it, it was still warm. In the oven, the coal was burning weakly. By the door, the tap was dripping. There were two beds, one narrow, one wide. I chose the narrow one. A flowery skirt was lying on it, so I guessed it must be the daughter's. I lay down and stared at the rain-stained ceiling. The more I thought about the last few hours, the less I cared. I was too tired to care about anything--and cold. Heavenly Bastard in the Sky, was I cold. As cold as that damp ceiling.<br><br>A whole month passed and no one came. I was the only visitor to the empty house. I spent every night there, free of charge. A guest house all to myself. At the end of the month I found a job and a new place to live.<br>When I left ginger hill village, it was like I took a step with my right foot and, by the time my left foot came to join it, four years had passed. For these four years I was just like some spare chair forgotten in the dark corner of a warehouse. My first Beijing job was as a cleaner in a hotel called the Day to Day People's Hostel. I wasn't allowed to clean the rooms, only the corridors and toilets, but at least I could share a bedroom with four of the other cleaners. I stuck it out for a year or so, but eventually I quit. Then I worked in a state-run toy factory making plastic guns and aeroplanes. There were about five thousand women workers and I couldn't stand the noise and stink of the dormitory, so I quit that job too. From then on, I kind of drifted from job to job. I spent a few months in a tin-can factory monitoring the tin-can-making machines, until finally I ended up as a cleaner at a rundown old cinema called The Young Pioneers.

Roosevelt coined the slogan &#34;The Arsenal of Democracy&#34; to describe American might during the grim years of World War II. The man who financed that arsenal was his Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. This is the first book to focus on the wartime achievements of this unlikely hero-a dyslexic college dropout who turned himself into a forceful and efficient administrator and then exceeded even Roosevelt in his determination to defeat the Nazis.Based on extensive research at the FDR Library in Hyde Park, NY, author Peter Moreira describes Morgenthau&#39;s truly breathtaking accomplishments: He led the greatest financial program the world has ever seen, raising $310 billion (over $4.8 trillion in today&#39;s dollars) to finance the war effort. This was largely done without the help of Wall Street by appealing to the patriotism of the average citizen through the sale of war bonds. In addition, he championed aid to Britain before America entered the war; initiated and oversaw the War Refugee Board, spearheading the rescue of 200,000 Jews from the Nazis; and became the architect of the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, which produced the modern economic paradigm.The book also chronicles Morgenthau&#39;s many challenges, ranging from anti-Semitism to the postwar &#34;Morgenthau Plan&#34; that was his undoing.This is a captivating story about an understated and often overlooked member of the Roosevelt cabinet who played a pivotal role in the American war effort to defeat the Nazis.</p><p><b>Peter Moreira</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Hemingway on the China Front: His WWII Spy Mission with Martha Gellhorn&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Backwater: Nova Scotia&#x2019;s Economic Decline</i>.

For many years he also worked as a reporter for&nbsp;<i>The Deal</i>, Bloomberg Financial News, and Knight-Ridder Financial News."Peter Moreira ably demonstrates that Morgenthau was not just FDR's buddy but also a great secretary of the Treasury and American Jewish leader whose critical role in the Allied victory in World War II has been underestimated by historians.

While one might wonder at the need to revise and update fiction, this is done because of new facts revealed about each side's plans and strategies, so it offers a revision based on the latest knowledge of events and behind-the-scenes politics on both sides. While newcomers will thoroughly appreciate Team Yankee, prior fans of the old version will find this new remake adds more depth and information, and will appreciate its revealing perspective.

After being published for several years in Scandinavia and featured in Dark Horse Presents it&#39;s finally getting collected in the US by Dark Horse Comics, as The Complete Love Hurts. 2012 Kim W. released his first graphic novel, Alena. Also a romantic horror comic, but this time a lot darker. Alena is at the moment being made into a motion picture, coming out 2015! The author lives in Hagersten, Sweden."In a beautiful show of skill and grace, a skating duo take to the ice to compete for the world championship. As the audience &#x201c;oohs&#x201d; and &#x201c;aahs,&#x201d; the man tells his female partner he has been cheating on her. So she responds a little rashly . . . by severing his head with her skate at the end of the routine. The twisted scenarios in Love Hurts recall &#x2019;50s horror comics like Tales from the Crypt, which lured their audience in through shock and dark humor rather than complicated story and development. The stories are often only two- to three-pages long, and, as with any anthology, some are more original than others. But with more than 30 short stories, there&#x2019;s a lot here for any horror fan to devour. Andersson&#x2019;s character design often accentuates the obscurity of each situation, with manic smiles and dead set eyes, while also giving a retro vibe that pays homage to the golden age of horror comics. Not for the faint of heart, but wicked fun for the right audience."&nbsp;&#x2014; Peter Blenski, <i>Booklist</i></p><h2>Sheldon&#39;s Adventures in Heaven: Imagine What It Will Be Like After Jesus Comes...</h2><p>Imagine what it will be like after Jesus comes. . . <br> Sheldon's Adventures in Heaven<br><br> <p>The great war on earth was finally over.

It has been said that &#34;the secret to great wine starts in the vineyard,&#34; and &#34;you can make poor-quality wine out of high-quality grapes, but you cannot expect to make great wine from poor-quality grapes.&#34; Growing high-quality grapes for premium wine requires the grower to fully understand the principles of viticulture. The new revised edition of the Grape Grower&#39;s Handbook is a complete rewrite and provides the grower with a broad spectrum of expertise and knowledge in growing grapes for wine grape production in commercial vineyards. Some books offer a strong academic perspective with little practical application on growing grapes for wine production, others books offer a broad overview on growing grapes but provide little detail while most books narrowly focus only on more traditional topics of grape growing. Unlike most books on growing grapes for wine production the Grape Grower&#39;s Handbook is meant to be a stand-alone publication that describes all aspects of wine grape production. The book is written in a nontechnical format designed to be practical and wellsuited for field application. Some of the topics discussed but not limited to include grapevine growth, varieties, rootstocks, climate requirements, training and pruning, canopy management, development and nutrition, water and soil management, pests and diseases, pesticide application, frost protection, winter protection of grapevines, cover crops, and pre-harvest operations. The book is thoughtfully organized presenting a seamless flow of topics within chapters making it easy to find specific information that interests the reader. No one concerned with the growing of grapes for wine production can afford to be without this book.</p><p></p><h2>Power of the Witch</h2><p>Written by a practicing witch who conducts classes and seminars on witchcraft--the oldest Western religion, a means of power and enlightenment, and a healing art--Power of the Witch makes it debut in trade paperback formst.</p><p><b>Laurie Cabot</b>, known as the &#x201c;official Witch of Salem,&#x201d; has been a practicing Witch for more than 40 years.

Pa again had come home drunk and mean; the trauma of the subsequent scene had been repeated as long as Damaris could remember. The idea that she no longer needs to tolerate this, that maybe she's old enough to manage on her own, is planted in her mind and begins to grow. She must plan her escape carefully, but she must get away from him.<p></p><p>When the opportunity comes, Damaris carries with her the strength of her mother's love. Two treasures hidden for years from her father her grandmother's lacy golden brooch and her grandfather's lovely watch are Damaris' only legacy from her past. That and her name. Her mother said it came from the Bible and had a special meaning that she can't remember anymore. What difference might it make?</p><p>But Damaris can't escape the "aloneness" that haunts her life or the bitterness she feels when she sees others suffering, particularly children.

Reprint.</p><p>John A. McDougall, M.D. is the founder and director of the McDougall Program at St. Helena Hospital in the Napa Valley of California.Making a strong pitch for the vegan lifestyle, McDougall (The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss) freely criticizes mainstream medicine for scanting nutritional advice. Unlike the modest dietary changes recommended by such authorities as the Texas Heart Institute (see above), McDougall, who runs a cardiac program at St. Helena Hospital in California's Napa Valley, bans all animal products-fish, poultry, eggs, even nonfat dairy-from his no-cholesterol, under-10%-fat diet. Though the emphasis is primarily on nutrition (two weeks of menu plans, 100 recipes and extensive brand-name shopping lists are provided), McDougall also discusses exercise and stress management, medications and surgical procedures and offers plenty of cautionary words on diagnostic tests. Peppering his lively prose with anecdotes, McDougall is persuasive and upbeat about his program's success in preventing as well as treating heart disease, but his demanding regime will likely appeal most to the highly motivated, especially those already experiencing heart problems. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wild Ride</h2><p>Buckling Down by Moira Keith - Levi is in Vegas with one simple goal: cement his place in rodeo history.

One weekend of uninterrupted sexual decadence with him is tempting but will it solve anything? The Real Deal by Niki Green - When Willa looks out into the crowd during her burlesque act and sees a familiar face staring back, her past comes crashing down around her. Chase has some hard questions for the former love of his life, and he wants answers even if he has to throw her over his shoulder and drag her back home</p><p>Niki Green knew at the tender age of four, when she created her first tall, dark and handsome hero (in the form of an imaginary husband named James) that the make-believe world was just too hard to ignore. Now, everyday is an adventure for her and the hero&#x2019;s and heroine&#x2019;s she creates. On any given day she can be found relaxing under the hot southern sun with a book in one hand and her laptop in the other. When she is not reading or writing, which is hardly ever, she loves to spend time with her husband (a great sport even though he does blush quite often) and her darling daughter (whose creativity knows no bounds). When Lorelei James is not squirreled away behind her laptop in the Black Hills of Western South Dakota, she can be found reading, shootin' her .22, watching the Professional Bull Riders tour, and running a kid's taxi service, all in the guise of avoiding housework and rustlin' up vittles.

With examples from nearly every continent, the book documents the diverse methods people have used to create shelter from locally available natural materials, and shows the impressively handmade finished products through this truly stunning compilation of photographs. Unlike modern buildings that rely on industrially produced materials and highly specialized electric tools and techniques, the shelters featured here represent a rapidly disappearing genre of handcrafted and beautifully composed structures. They are the work of simple and real people who, as builders and homesteaders, have integrated artistic beauty and practical form into their shelter needs. Shelter the Human Family offers insights into the world of vernacular building, along with potential solutions to many of the problems that plague modern architecture. It is a must-have collection that preserves and documents the rich cultural past of each structure and its community, and offers inspiration for those looking to build in a way that is motivated by something larger than speed, efficiency, and economic profit. Bill and Athena Steen are the authors of The Straw Bale House and The Beauty of Straw Bale. They are active in community building programs that teach low-income families how to build their own shelters, and known for their efforts to incorporate artistic techniques based on local and natural materials into the world of modern construction.

But while she tries to play catch-up with her beautiful, politically connected cousin, Kendall, and is commissioned to furnish a chic Japanese-fusion restaurant, things start to go haywire. First, Kendall vanishes from the restaurant's opening-night party, and then Rei is drafted to help Andrea, the restaurant's elegant, cagey hostess, investigate the disappearance of her own Japanese mother thirty years earlier.</p><p>As the strands of these puzzles begin to come together, Rei finds that her relationship with her fianc�, Hugh, has changed from sizzle to burn. At the same time, she faces troubling questions about what it means to be a loving mother -- and whether her own independent streak will endanger the women to whom she has grown close.</p><p>Rei must research the scary old days of the Vietnam War and delve into the secret history of an ambitious presidential candidate to piece together the mystery of the vanished women -- and also understand truths about herself, which may change her destiny.</p><p>In <em>The Pearl Diver</em>, Sujata Massey delivers a multilayered, suspenseful story complete with the intrigue, romance, and rich Asian cultural background that her fans have come to relish.</p></p><p><p>Sujata Massey was a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em> and spent several years in Japan teaching English and studying Japanese. She is the author of <em>The Salaryman's Wife, Zen Attitude, The Flower Master, The Floating Girl, The Bride's Kimono, The Samurai's Daughter, The Pearl Diver,</em> and <em>The Typhoon Lover</em>. She lives in Minneapolis. </p>Kidnapping, death and intrigue are all on the menu for Rei Shimura in Massey's winning seventh mystery (after 2003's <i>The Samurai's Daughter</i>) to feature the half-Japanese, half-American antique dealer and sometime sleuth. After moving in with her fianc�, lawyer Hugh Glendinning, in Washington, D.C., Rei takes on the decoration of a trendy new Asian restaurant, Bento. Barred from reentering Japan, where her business was originally based, she hopes to plan her upcoming wedding and find a market for the art objects she's stored locally. All hell breaks loose when Rei's cousin Kendall Johnson disappears during the opening dinner at Bento, leaving Rei with Kendall's twin toddlers. Then Bento's hostess approaches Rei for help in locating her Japanese-born mother, a war bride who went missing from her Virginia home more than 30 years earlier. Finally, sweet Aunt Norie arrives from Japan to help with the wedding preparations and ever-dependable Hugh makes himself scarce for propriety's sake. Crosscultural misunderstandings and prejudices, plus behind-the-scenes machinations, add spice to an already volatile mix. Adept at crafting dead-on dialogue and juggling serious issues with humor, Massey has produced another triumph.

Offering a complex, densely layered montage, based on extensive interviews with over one hundred women--each of whom has ``found her own direct relationship with the divine or the real''- -the authors seek to extend studies positing a distinctly feminine moral development to a consideration of ``the way women experience the sacred in their lives.'' Included are ministers, rabbis, priests, nuns, and former nuns (both Christian and Vedantic), spiritual healers, tribal elders, and contemplatives, working variously as therapists, teachers, writers, artists, and social activists, and all meeting a basic requirement of striving to ``embody'' their beliefs ``in everyday life.'' Most compelling within this spiritual supermarket are several detailed looks at individual quests--ranging from that of the Kabbala teacher who returned to Orthodox Judaism after exploring secularism and Sufism to that of the one-time southern beauty queen who transformed herself from a drug-addicted, alcoholic prostitute into a pioneering massage therapist for AIDS victims. Unfortunately, the frequently intriguing material is shoehorned into an unoriginal garden metaphor (leaving home to enter ``sacred'' gardens, cultivating plots with a variety of tools, etc.) that becomes cloying. Also a bit disconcerting are the constant references to the authors' own struggles to shape the work, usually resolved through meditation and never as interesting as the research itself. Still, there's much food for thought here--more than enough to sate human-potential devotees and to provide tantalizing tidbits for everyone else. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The authors interviewed women across the country about "the unfolding of the sacred in their lives." A Seneca elder in upstate New York tells how the stones speak to her. "I'm just a vessel that God works through," says a community worker in Watts, Los Angeles, who radiates love to her "extended family." Other interviewees include a massage therapist, a professor of English, a rabbi, an ex-nun, artists, a Jungian analyst, Maya Angelou and members of a feminist spiritual community in Maine. Anderson, a Zen teacher, and Hopkins, coauthor of Good-bye to Guilt , conduct workshops across the country on feminine spirituality. If their writing has a rosy New Age tinge, the in-depth personal stories they relate are insightful, and their illuminating narrative is structured like a spiritual journey (childhood, leaving home, gateways, entering the sacred garden, relationships) to assist women in defining for themselves what is sacred. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>From This Day On (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.</p><p>LAUREN BROOKE lives outside London in an old English farmhouse.

Original. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Fans of Takaya's <i>Fruits Basket</i> may find <i>Tsubasa</i> a bit disappointing. Takaya's earlier work is a sprawling fantasy that lacks the originality and emotional impact of <i>Fruits Basket</i>. The weaker characters, mediocre artwork and poorly written and paced plot line does little to capture attention. The tale is set in a war-torn 22nd century mysteriously similar to <i>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</i>, where luxury and amenities are reserved for the upper classes. The common people live for the legend of the Tsubasa, a magical glowing object said to grant wishes to all who see it&#x2014;not unlike the dragon in <i>Dragonball</i>. To add to the pastiche of clich�s, heroine Kotobuki the thief is monkeylike, similar to Goku. Despite the epic setting, much of the story focuses on Kotobuki's hackneyed romance with Raimon, a genius who dropped out of a prestigious army position in order to date her. The slow-building junior high&#x2013;like romance ties together a series of nearly unrelated episodes. Two-thirds of the way through, the book has a satisfying ending, yet the story continues. Although the series was six volumes long in Japan, Tokyopop has made the excellent choice to publish it here in fewer, thicker volumes. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The story takes place in a future where the planet is barren, and young thief Kotobuki is trying to turn to more honest work for a living. While she tries to make ends meet, she is followed by an ex-commander from the military who says he is in love with her. In the background, rumors swirl about something called tsubasa, which supposedly can grant wishes. No one knows what exactly tsubasa is, how it works, or even if it exists, but this doesn&#x2019;t stop people from avidly&nbsp;searching for it or joining cults that revolve around it. Natsuki Takaya already has a large worldwide following, so she&#x2019;s sure to have many readers flocking to get their hands on this fantasy manga as well.

But things have not exactly been breaking right lately for the Alaskan PI. The logical thing to do? Take a vacation cruise.<br><br>Well, it's not exactly a vacation. Younger has been paid to investigate a suspicious ship's doctor aboard a luxurious first-class cruise ship. Now Younger finds himself trapped on a ship of fools with a murderer who is leaving a trail of well-to-do passengers in his wake...and leaving evidence pointing an accusing finger at Cecil! By the time the S.S. <i>Westward</i> makes landfall up the Alaskan coast, Younger will be wishing he was back guarding chickens...instead of sleeping with the fishes.</p><p>If Cecil Younger, John Straley's Alaska P.I., plied his trade in the lower 48, he'd probably have to work another job to pay his rent. As it is, he barely ekes out a living chasing chickens as well as two-legged deadbeats in Sitka, where he lives with an autistic roommate and a part-time lover who's a lot more ambitious than he is. So when he's offered a job investigating why so many people are dying on the SS <i>Westward</i>, Straley takes readers along on a luxury cruise in the icy waters of the Inland Passage. <i>L'Inconnue de la Seine</i> is a very unusual travel club--while most of its members are in ill health to begin with, there's something besides coincidence that's killing them before their time. Is it the ship's doctor who's responsible, or are there more sinister forces at work? When Cecil stumbles onto the truth behind the escalating mortality rates, he's rudely put ashore on an island inhabited only by bears. Fortunately for him, his girlfriend is a marine biologist who not only knows how to make a gourmet dinner out of sea slugs but can also talk a hungry bear out of having her and Cecil for dessert. What makes Straley's series so interesting are his extraordinary descriptive talents--if this is as close to Alaska as the reader of these finely wrought novels ever gets, it's almost as good as being there. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Praise For John Straley: <p>"Now and then a writer dares to flout the rules and, in so doing, carves out a niche that belongs to him alone.

Late on her first day back&#x2014;minus ten points.<br><br>"Welcome back."<br><br>Carlotta turned and manufactured a smile for Lindy Russell, her boss, who was standing with arms crossed. "Thank you. It's good to be back."<br><br>Lindy pursed her mouth. "Too bad you couldn't make this morning's staff meeting."<br><br>Carlotta's smile wavered, but she massaged the flexible cast on her arm. "Sorry. This morning was the first time I'd driven in a while, and my car battery was dead." She didn't think it would help to mention that the MARTA trains were being single-tracked for construction. Still, she decided not to dwell on transportation challenges since her recent medical leave had come on the heels of a two-week suspension to "get her personal issues worked out."<br><br>Personal issues such as her brother's gambling debts, her ruined credit, the fact that her parents were long-lost fugitives...and oh, she'd been entangled in a couple of murders as a by-product of her part-time hobby as a body mover for the morgue.<br><br>"Things happen," Lindy conceded. "Is your arm healing well?"<br><br>Carlotta flexed the fingers of the arm that had been broken when a killer had pushed her over the balcony of the Fox Theatre, where she'd dangled with her skirt around her waist for all the attendees of an Elton John concert to see. "Almost as good as new." Though, at the moment it was throbbing like a toothache.<br><br>Sympathy crossed Lindy's face. "I can't tell you how sorry I am about Michael."<br><br>Michael Lane, aka the person who'd pushed her over the balcony, had been Carlotta's former coworker and friend. He'd also turned out to have some very dark secrets.<br><br>"Me, too," Carlotta murmured, wishing her heart could be splinted like her arm had been.<br><br>"I don't suppose you've heard from him?"<br><br>She shook her head. "I was told he's in the psych ward at Northside Hospital until he's deemed competent to stand trial."<br><br>"So terrible." Lindy sighed, then checked the clipboard she held. "Well, life goes on, doesn't it?"<br><br>Carlotta blinked. It was true, but still...<br><br>"I'm glad you could come back in time for the Eva McCoy appearance." Lindy swept her arm toward the small dais that had been erected on the sales floor with several rows of cordoned-off chairs for seating.<br><br>Olympian Eva McCoy's return to her hometown had been hyped on all the media outlets for weeks. "That's today?"<br><br>Lindy arched an eyebrow.<br><br>Carlotta backpedaled. "I mean... that's today."<br><br>"Since you missed the staff meeting, here's the info." Lindy handed over a memo. "It's going to be a mob scene so I'll need all my best employees on the floor."<br><br>Pleasure suffused Carlotta's chest&#x2014;her history of being a consistent top salesperson still meant something.<br><br>"And here's one now," Lindy said, looking past Carlotta's shoulder. Carlotta turned and swallowed a curse when she saw Patricia Alexander, aka Stepford Salesclerk, complete with rounded-collar suit, helmet hair and strand of pearls, walking toward them.<br><br>The blonde flashed a waxy smile. "I'd heard you were coming back, Carlotta, but when I didn't see you at this morning's staff meeting, I assumed that something else had happened. You're so... accident prone."<br><br>Carlotta's mouth tightened.<br><br>"I'll let you two catch up for a couple of minutes before the crowd arrives," Lindy said, handing them each a roll of tickets to be passed out to customers who wanted to meet the guest of honor. Then she gave Carlotta a pointed look. "I tend to agree with Patricia. There's going to be a lot of security on hand today, so try not to do anything that might draw extra attention." Lindy walked off, leaving Carlotta properly chastised&#x2014;in front of her nemesis.<br><br>"Ouch," Patricia chirped.<br><br>Carlotta was able to hold her tongue because she knew she deserved far worse from her boss than a reprimand for all her... mishaps. Determined to get along with Lindy's new pet employee, she turned toward Patricia. "I suppose you took Michael's place in Shoes?"<br><br>"Yes. It's such a shame, isn't it, that he turned out to be totally insane?"<br><br>Carlotta bit her tongue.<br><br>"So, I'll bet you're happy to be back to work," Patricia offered. "You were probably bored to tears doing nothing all day."<br><br>"I didn't exactly do nothing," Carlotta muttered, although she couldn't exactly tell Patricia about the road trip she'd taken with Coop for a VIP body pickup, the unexpected appearance of her father, and the capture of a murderer while she'd been "incapacitated," on leave with a broken arm. Instead she pasted on a smile. "But I am happy to be back in my element."<br><br>Patricia made rueful noises in her throat. "I hope you had time to rest, you poor thing. The heartbreak you've been through the past decade&#x2014;you must be close to the brink of insanity yourself."<br><br>Carlotta's hands fisted. Patricia moved in the Buckhead social circles, so she knew the sordid Wren family history&#x2014;that ten years ago Carlotta's father had been accused of stealing from his investment clients and had skipped town rather than face a trial, with her mother in tow, abandoning Carlotta and her younger brother to fend for themselves.<br><br>At the thought of her brother, Wesley, Carlotta stole a glance at her watch. He should be arriving at the Fulton County D.A.'s office right about now, hopefully working out a plea agreement, testifying against one of his loan sharks in return for reduced charges for his part in the attempted theft of a body. His attorney, Liz, was hopeful that Wesley would get off with having his community service sentence from a prior computer hacking charge extended. But Carlotta was worried that even Liz Fuck-Me Fischer wouldn't be able to parlay enough sexual favors to make it happen. Carlotta had wanted to go with Wesley today, but he'd refused, saying it was something he needed to take care of himself. It might have been the moment she'd been most proud of him.<br><br>Except for the fact that he could be sitting in a jail cell before her shift ended.<br><br>What would she do for bail money? And what if Wesley didn't get out this time?<br><br>Patricia waved her hand in front of Carlotta's face. "Did I lose you?"<br><br>"No," she said, squaring her shoulders. "And I'm coping with everything just fine."<br><br>Patricia leaned in. "If you need something to take the edge off, I can spot you some antianxiety meds."<br><br>"No, thank you," Carlotta said through gritted teeth, although beneath the cast her arm was hot with pain. Knowing it would <em>really </em>hurt, though, if she slugged the woman, Carlotta changed the subject. "Looks like we're going to have a big crowd today for Eva McCoy."<br><br>"Yeah, speaking of crazy.... The woman wins a marathon after a bout of food poisoning, gives all the credit to a lucky charm bracelet and suddenly charm bracelets are selling like mad." Patricia shook her head, apparently bemused with the trend.<br><br>Carlotta smirked. Her coworker was only frustrated because <em>she </em>wasn't working in Jewelry, earning commissions on the trinkets that Eva would be promoting.<br><br>Customers were already gathering in the area of the dais where posters featured the smiling, fit Olympian with a gold medal around her neck and a "Lucky Charm Bracelet" on her slender wrist.<br><br>Carlotta and Patricia positioned themselves in front of the GET YOUR TICKETS TO MEET EVA McCOY HERE sign and began handing out tickets, and directing early comers where to sit or stand.<br><br>"So," Patricia asked without making eye contact. "How are you and Peter Ashford?"<br><br>Choosing her words carefully, Carlotta said, "Peter and I are old friends."<br><br>"So I've heard. Tracey Tully Lowenstein belongs to my club. She said that you and Peter used to be quite the item before... your family issues."<br><br>"That was a long time ago," Carlotta murmured.<br><br>"Tracey intimated that you two have picked up where you left off."<br><br>"Tracey talks too much," Carlotta said pointedly.<br><br>"I think it's nice that you and Peter have each other," Patricia said. "You can support each other. You know, with his wife having been murdered, and then all that you've gone through." The blonde winced. "Wait a minute. Weren't you a suspect in her murder? Gee, that has to be a little awkward."<br><br>"Not at all," Carlotta said pleasantly.<br><br>Patricia sniffed and turned her back.<br><br>Carlotta shot daggers into the woman's bony shoulder blades. In truth, Carlotta was still wrestling with her recent decision to cozy up to her former fianc�. When her father had walked up to her, unannounced and in disguise, at a rest area a few weeks ago in Florida, he'd told her to stay close to Peter&#x2014;that since Peter worked for Mashburn &amp; Tully Investments where her father had once been a partner, he was in the best position to help prove Randolph Wren's innocence. Until that moment, Carlotta would have sworn that if her long-lost father had ever approached her, she would slap him, kick his shins, spit in his face and call the police. Instead she'd been gelatinous and cooperative and... hopeful.<br><br>The fact that he made her want to believe that he'd been framed for his white collar crime made her feel used all over again.<br><br>Her father was using her&#x2014;and she was using Peter. Since his wife's untimely death, Peter had made no secret that he wanted to get back with Carlotta. He'd even recovered the Cartier engagement ring that she'd pawned, <em>and </em>he'd had a diamond added on either side of the original solitaire. He was holding it for her, hoping she'd agree to pick up where they'd left off years ago. Just as if he hadn't ripped out her heart by turning his back on her when she needed him most.<br><br>But he was trying to make amends, she conceded. He'd helped Wesley out of a couple of scrapes and continued to be attentive to her. A couple of weeks ago, though, after she'd returned from Florida, his patience had worn thin. He'd been offered a position in New York and had been going to take it, unless she could make room for him in her life. She couldn't risk him leaving, on the chance that her father might call or put in another appearance soon, in need of Peter's inside access. So she'd told Peter to stay and had committed herself to making their relationship a priority.<br><br>Normally, being on the receiving end of a handsome, rich man's attentions wouldn't pose a problem, but there were... extenuating circumstances. Namely, two other men bouncing around in her head and in her heart.<br><br>"I wondered if I'd see you here."<br><br>At the sound of a familiar rumbling voice, her pulse spiked. She turned around to see one of those two men, Detective Jack Terry, standing there with a sardonic smile on his ruggedly handsome face, as if she'd conjured him up. Her entire body smiled. "Hi, Jack."<br><br>"Back to work, huh?"<br><br>She nodded. "First day."<br><br>"Are you okay? You look flushed."<br><br>She put a hand to her warm cheek. "Hectic morning. What are you doing here?"<br><br>"Extra security for Eva McCoy. It's a favor for the mayor."<br><br>Carlotta frowned. "What does the city have to do with this?"<br><br>"Apparently Eva's uncle is a state senator. He wants APD on the scene just in case. And since a uniform might send the wrong signal..." He shrugged. "Here I am."<br><br>She surveyed his gray suit and gave his red tie a tug. "You look good."<br><br>"I keep telling him that red is his color."<br><br>At the sound of a purring voice, Carlotta turned her head. A doe-eyed, exotic beauty in a dark suit stepped into Jack's personal space.<br><br>Jack gave the woman a proprietary smile. "Carlotta, I don't think you've met my new partner, Detective Maria Marquez. Maria, this is Carlotta Wren, a friend of mine."<br><br>Carlotta tried not to react. Friends? Is that what she and Jack were?<br><br>She had seen the woman once, at a distance. Up close, Maria was even more...<em>wow</em>. She was almost as tall as Jack, with killer curves, and caramel-colored hair smoothed back from her face in a clasp at the nape of her neck.<br><br>"Nice to meet you, Carlotta." Maria's English was precise, seasoned with the kind of curling accent that made words like <em>blitzkrieg </em>and <em>psoriasis </em>sound sexy.<br><br>"Same here," Carlotta murmured.<br><br>When she'd razzed Jack about getting a partner, she'd envisioned a grumpy middle-aged man with hair in his ears, not a Latina siren with perfect teeth and no wedding ring. Damn, the woman even had good taste&#x2014;her suit was Ellen Tracy and the pumps were Stuart Weitzman. Carlotta knew her own Betsey Johnson tunic dress and Fendi platform sandals could hold their own, but the cast on her arm was an unsightly accessory she couldn't wait to be rid of. And she tongued the gap between her front teeth self-consciously.<br><br>"So you work at Neiman's?" Maria asked. The way she said it left the unspoken comparison of "and I carry a gun" hanging in the air.<br><br>"That's right," Carlotta said.<br><br>"Carlotta also moonlights for the morgue," Jack supplied cheerfully. "She's a body mover."<br><br>Carlotta squirmed. The gorgeous giantess packing heat made her feel like an underachiever. And short.<br><br>"A body mover? How...diverse. Is that how the two of you met?"<br><br>Carlotta exchanged a glance with Jack. He looked at Maria. "Not exactly. I'll fill you in later," he added in a low voice.<br><br>Great. He'd tell Maria all about her criminal family&#x2014; her fugitive folks, her delinquent brother... Not to mention Carlotta's own scrapes with the law. And her futile&#x2014;and inept&#x2014;efforts to hold her life and family together.<br><br>"Speaking of your morbid hobby, how is Coop?" Jack asked her with wry amusement.<br><br>Cooper Craft&#x2014;her brother's body-moving boss who had pulled her in on a couple of jobs... and who'd made it known that he wouldn't mind them being more than friends. Coop was a former medical examiner. He and Jack maintained a relationship that existed primarily of circling each other like two big-racked bucks, but collaborating when necessary.<br><br>"With this bum arm, I haven't been helping Coop lately," she said. "And after Wesley conspired with those thugs to steal the body we were hauling from Florida back to Atlanta...well, let's just say he needs to earn back Coop's trust before they work together again."<br><br>Her brother with the genius IQ somehow rationalized making the wrong choice at almost every juncture. She bit her lip and wondered how he was faring in court.<br><br>"Despite Wesley's interference, Coop received a lot of attaboys for the way he handled that VIP body pickup&#x2014; and the aftermath," Jack said. "I hear that Abrams might give him more access to the active cases at the morgue."<br><br></p><h2>Spinning the Wheel of Ana</h2><p>An insight into the origins of the Glastonbury Goddess-Avalon tradition of Kathy Jones.

Sixty years later, after retiring from his career as a plant biologist, he set out to find the trees that had transfixed him in his youth. Discovering many of them felled by storms or loggers, he determined to document those that were left before they could vanish from our memories as well as from our landscapes. The catalogue Dr. Carder compiled is a definitive record of the West's record-sized trees of all species, including such legends as BC's 400-plus foot Lynn Valley fir and California's massive redwood, the Eureka Tree. Next, Dr. Carder set out to answer the question, how do the giant trees of the West stack up against the great trees of the world?<br>The result, Giant Trees of Western America and the World, reveals outstanding examples from each of the most noteworthy tree species Dr. Carder found--including some that are thousands of years old and over 300 feet high. Featuring more than 40 scale drawings, this collection of giant trees outlines the intriguing characteristics of each species, such as the resiliency of the English oak, which can endure lightning strikes and widespread rot for hundreds of years and still thrive; and the "grotesque" appearance of the African "upside-down tree," the baobab, whose width can exceed its height. Dr. Carder also describes the histories of famous trees, including the stump of a BC western red cedar so wide that eight men and women danced a quadrille on it in 1887, and the Sicilian Tree of 100 Horses, well-known for sheltering Joan, Queen of Aragon and 100 of her horsemen in a storm.

Ying&#x2019;s carved face twisted into an angry scowl. How many times was he going to have to save her life tonight? He turned and slammed the door closed on the burning arena of the Jinan Fight Club.<br><br>Inside the club&#x2019;s main tunnel, Ying&#x2019;s eyes quickly adjusted to the orange-yellow glow of torches lining the stone-walled corridor. He glanced down at Hok and, next to her, Seh. Through the smoke drifting in from under the door, Ying saw that Hok held a tiny jade crane in one hand and Malao&#x2019;s ornate monkey stick in the other. Both were trophies from her time in the pit arena.<br><br>In his own hands, Ying held his long chain whip and a ring of keys he&#x2019;d just taken from LaoShu, the <i>qiang</i>-wielding fight club owner.

The nagging injuries were <i>his </i>trophies, presented to him in prison by General Tsung almost a month before. Ying wrapped his chain whip around his waist and groaned. He grabbed the collar of Hok&#x2019;s dress, yanking her to her feet.<br><br>&#x201c;Move!&#x201d; Ying hissed, pointing down the corridor. He looked at his former brother Seh. &#x201c;You too.&#x201d;<br><br>Hok took a step forward, but Seh didn&#x2019;t react. He just stared at Ying, blank-faced. <i>What is wrong with Seh? </i>Ying wondered. He reached out to slap some sense into him, but Hok grabbed his arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Seh is blind,&#x201d; Hok said. &#x201c;Not deaf. He had an accident.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Blind?&#x201d;Ying said. &#x201c;Leave him, then.&#x201d; <br><br>Hok shook her head.&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Ying shrugged. &#x201c;Suit yourself.&#x201d; He spun around and walked quickly down the tunnel corridor, the rough cotton robe of his Pit Cleaner disguise chafing his beaten flesh.<br><br>&#x201c;Ying, wait,&#x201d; Hok said. She took Seh by the arm and hurried after Ying. Ying slowed for a moment, scanning the corridor. He saw no sign of guards ahead. They must have cleared out after the fire began. Ying glanced back and saw Hok and Seh catching up. They looked like a pair of children whose dress-up tea party had ended in a fistfight. Hok&#x2019;s elegant silk dress was torn in several places and bloodstained from her fierce battle with General Tsung in the pit arena. Seh&#x2019;s simple gray robe was covered in dirt and splotches of who knows what else from rolling along the pitarena floor en route to this tunnel. <br><br>Ying began to walk again. Hok and Seh remained on his tail.<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you helping us?&#x201d;Hok soon asked in a low voice.<br><br>&#x201c;You got me out of that prison back in Kaifeng,&#x201d;<br><br>Ying replied. &#x201c;I am returning the favor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You already met your end of our bargain,&#x201d;Hok said.<br><br>&#x201c;You gave me information that helped me find Malao.&#x201d;<br><br>Ying scoffed.&#x201c;Maybe you would consider information an equal trade for someone&#x2019;s life, but I do not. My injuries were too great for me to have survived much longer there.You saved my life, and I am honor-bound to return the favor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But how did you know we would be here in Jinan, at the fight club?&#x201d;Hok asked. <br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t come to Jinan looking for you,&#x201d; Ying replied. &#x201c;I came looking for Tonglong. I have a score to settle with him, and he frequents the fight clubs. I saw you and Seh standing in line outside with the round eye. I assumed you were up to something, and also assumed you would fail. I saw this as an opportunity to repay my debt.&#x201d;<br><br>Ying rounded a corner. Ahead of him were rows of holding cells for prisoners who were scheduled to fight that night. All of the cells were empty save two. Inside one sat Fu. Malao was in the other.<br><br>Fu roared when he saw Ying, but Malao began to shriek, &#x201c;Ying! Ying!&#x201d;<br><br>One of Malao&#x2019;s shoulders was bloodstained, and he had a huge lump on the side of his head. Ying ignored him.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d; Malao asked. &#x201c;Are those <i>keys </i>in your hand?&#x201d;<br>Ying hurried past without acknowledging him. He picked up his pace.<br><br>&#x201c;Ying, wait!&#x201d;Malao wailed. &#x201c;Come back!&#x201d; Ying glanced over his shoulder and saw Hok heading toward the cells with Seh.<br><br>&#x201c;Hok! Hok!&#x201d;Malao shrieked. &#x201c;Help us!&#x201d;<br><br>Fu roared again.<br><br>&#x201c;Ying!&#x201d; Hok said. &#x201c;Please come back. Malao is hurt.We need those keys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Ying said, turning away. &#x201c;I need the keys for the exit door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let them out first,&#x201d;Hok said. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Ying said. &#x201c;There are too many keys on this ring. By the time I figure out which ones will open their cells, we could be dead from smoke or something else. I won&#x2019;t risk it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not leaving here without Fu and Malao,&#x201d;Hok said.<br><br>&#x201c;Then my debt has been repaid,&#x201d;Ying said. &#x201c;Goodbye.&#x201d;<br><br>Ying rounded another corner and began to run. <i>Foolish children, </i>he thought. <i>Don&#x2019;t know when to cut</i> <i>their losses.</i><br><br>Ying reached the end of the next passageway and came to a halt. The tunnel split in two directions. One way led to a set of stairs that went up to the fight club, while the other corridor sloped gently upward toward a ground-level exit door. If he were to encounter any guards or others fleeing the burning fight club, this would be the place.<br><br>Ying squeezed the key ring tight so it wouldn&#x2019;t jingle and peered around the corner. Smoke was streaming toward the exit. That meant the exit door was open, sucking the smoke toward it.<br><br>Ying listened closely.<br><br>Down the corridor in the direction of the exit, he heard footsteps. Someone coughed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re being sent back in here,&#x201d; a man said. &#x201c;We should just wait by the exit door. It&#x2019;s the only way out for those kids.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>US Constitution: A Pocket Reference: US Constitution, Brief History, Declaration of Independence, Questions and Answers, Famous Quotes</h2><p><p>This is the most comprehensive "pocket" edition on the United States Constitution.

She was the author of The Stones of Florence and Birds of America, among other books.First novel by Mary Mccarthy. Originally published as six separate short stories, the novel appeared in 1942. Protagonist Margaret Sargent, a young student at a women's college, "a princess among the trolls," is based upon the author herself. The stories are barely disguised and acutely observed accounts of the author's own years as a young New Yorker and describe the failure of a marriage, random love affairs, and a passing flirtation with Trotskyism. Margaret's search for personal identity and her need for honesty and for distinguishing appearance from reality are the themes of the stories. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle (New Studies in Biblical Theology)</h2><p>The twentieth century has witnessed suffering and human cruelty on a scale never before imagined. Yet, paradoxically, the doctrine of original sin has undergone neglect in recent years. In this sophisticated treatment of the biblical evidence for original sin, Henri Blocher offers a robust study that interacts with the best scientific, literary, and theological thinking on the subject. Building his argument on a detailed analysis of the scriptural evidence for original sin, especially looking at key texts in Genesis and Romans, Blocher shows, with due consideration to current intellectual objections to the doctrine, that while the nature of original sin is certainly a mystery, only belief in it makes sense of evil and wrongdoing.</p><p>In October 2003, Henri Blocher was appointed to the Guenther H. Knoedler Chair of Theology at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. Since 1965 he has served as professor of systematic theology at the Facult� Libre de Th�ologie Evang�lique in Vaux-sur-Seine near Paris, France. A leading evangelical theologian and statesman, Blocher was a member of the Lausanne Committee on World Evangelization (1975-1980), served the World Evangelical Fellowship/Alliance in a number of capacities, and taught in schools in Europe, Australia, Africa, Canada and the US. He is currently president of the Fellowship of European Evangelical Theologians. Blocher studied at a number of institutions including the Sorbonne, London Bible College, Gordon Divinity School, and Facult� Libre de Th�ologie Protestant of Paris. He has written six books, four of which have appeared in English, and several dozen articles. His English publications include <em>Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle, Evil and the Cross: Christian Thought and the Problem of Evil</em> and <em>In the Beginning: The Opening chapters of Genesis.</em>Blocher, who teaches systematic theology at the Faculte Libre de Theologie Evangelique, Vaux-sur-Seine, France, approaches original sin as a riddle. As he sees it, the riddle arises not so much from original sin as from the widespread denial of the concept in a century marked by unprecedented violence and cruelty. After a general survey of biblical material, Blocher turns to Paul's discussion in Romans 5 of the relationship between Christ and Adam. He contends that a close reading of the fall of Adam does not bear the interpretation that Adam's sin and guilt were transferred to later generations. Rather, he asserts, the freedom of Adam's will to choose evil represents "an inborn state" that results in alienation from God. Freedom of the will is part of the human condition and that freedom entails a hereditary separation from God. However, Blocher sees this state as a "gate of hope" that opens humanity to compassion rather than despair. "Recognizing our radical separation from God and our potentail to choose evil should lead not to condemnation but to compassion." says Blocher. His account of original sin goes far in rehabilitating the doctrine of original sin from its traditionally negative associations. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Best Evidence : Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy</h2><p>They say truth is stranger than fiction. People often ask whether David Lifton is in touch with reality? Or is he intricately locked in a nightmare from which he never awoke? For my part, this is a genuine soul search. Lifton didn&#39;t gravitate in blind fury towards conspiracy. He didn&#39;t suspect vast numbers of people of deliberately hiding the truth. Whatever you think of his thesis, &#34;Best Evidence&#34; is saturated in analysis and held together by relentless logic. For me this makes his theory incredible. It also makes it impossible to dismiss. Suppose, if you will, that Oswald was the sole killer of JFK. In that case Lifton is totally wrong and his book is grotesque fiction. But it remains logical. His logic is just based on a false premise (to use his own language). For me the question is: are any of his crucial premises false? Lifton&#39;s conlusion is fantastic. But consider the alternative. For Lifton to be wrong, all the Parkland Hospital doctors and nurses, who originally attended Kennedy, collectively misperceived or falsely described what they saw. Or if they didn&#39;t, then all the Bethesda autopsy witnesses did. Lifton doesn&#39;t pull this testimony out of thin air. It&#39;s on the record. Lifton accounts for all of it in a way few other authors have done. Most critics on the subject rely on discrediting witnesses, usually on a large scale. The same problem applies to defenders of the Warren Report. The point about David Lifton is that he doesn&#39;t discredit. He explains. His explanation is outrageous, bizare and even absurd. Logic can be like that at times.</p><p></p><h2>How to Write Knockout Proposals: What You Must Know (And Say) to Win Funding Every Time</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

In clear, lucid prose, <i>PW </i>contributing editor Barbato demystifies a process most of us classify somewhere between daunting and incomprehensible. By the time you've finished reading, you'll believe you can do what he promises in the title; if you follow his user-friendly directions, you probably will. In 51 short chapters (two pages apiece), Barbato covers everything from why you need more than a good idea and how best to communicate with a particular funder. Some suggestions are obvious ("Find giving guidelines that resonate beautifully with your need. Then, you and the prospective donor will have, if not a bond, at least a strong interest in common"). Others are clearly the result of Barbato's experience as a veteran proposal writer and the author of five previous books. To get background information on a topic you're not familiar with, he suggests reading a young-adult novel in addition to surfing the Internet or checking encyclopedia articles. He also recommends waiting around if you're interviewing a source. "Let him stop you at the door as you're leaving," he writes. "I've found many experts at their lucid best just at that final moment in the interview. They want to make sure you understand." For anyone facing the difficult task of writing a funding proposal, Barbato's advice is sound, clear and to the point. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Geraldine Brooks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of March, has turned the intriguing but sparely detailed history of this precious volume into an emotionally rich, thrilling fictionalization that retraces its turbulent journey. In the hands of Hanna Heath, an impassioned rare-book expert restoring the manuscript in 1996 Sarajevo, it yields clues to its guardians and whereabouts: an insect wing, a wine stain, salt crystals, and a white hair. While readers experience crucial moments in the book's history through a series of fascinating, fleshed-out short stories, Hanna pursues its secrets scientifically, and finds that some interests will still risk everything in the name of protecting this treasure. A complex love story, thrilling mystery, vivid history lesson, and celebration of the enduring power of ideas, <i>People of the Book</i> will surely be hailed as one of the best of 2008. <i>--Mari Malcolm</i> <p> </p><p></p><p></p><p>In 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, is offered the job of a lifetime: analysis and conservation of the famous Sarajevo Haggadah, which was rescued during the Bosnian war.

In Bosnia during WW II, a Muslim risks his life to protect the book from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in a struggle against the city's rising anti-Semitism. In Inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it.

She&nbsp;lives and works in upstate New York.The Passenger Chapter 1<p></p> <br>WHEN I found my husband at the bottom of the stairs, I tried to resuscitate him before I ever considered disposing of the body. I pumped his barrel chest and blew into his purple lips. It was the first time in years that our lips had touched and I didn&#x2019;t recoil.<br> <br>I gave up after ten minutes. Frank Dubois was gone. Lying there all peaceful and quiet, he almost looked in slumber, but Frank was noisier asleep than he was awake. Honestly, if I had known what kind of snorer he was going to turn into, I never would have married him. If I could do it all over again, I never would have married him even if he slept like an angel. If I could do it all over again, there are so many things I would do differently. But looking at Frank then, so still and not talking, I didn&#x2019;t mind him so much. It seemed like a good time to say good-bye. I poured a shot of Frank&#x2019;s special bourbon, sat down on Frank&#x2019;s faux-suede La-Z-Boy, and had a drink to honor the dead.<br> <br>In case you were wondering, I didn&#x2019;t do it. I didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with Frank&#x2019;s death. I don&#x2019;t have an alibi, so you&#x2019;ll have to take my word for it. I was taking a shower when Frank died. As far as I could tell, he fell down the staircase all on his own. He had been suffering from vertigo lately. Convenient, I know. And I doubt he mentioned it to anyone. If I had waited for the police and told them the truth, maybe life could have continued as normal. Minus Frank.<br> <br>I poured another drink and contemplated my options. My first thought was to dispose of the body. Then I&#x2019;d tell the authorities that Frank left me for another woman. Or was running from a loan shark. It was well-known that he had a love for cards but no talent for it.<br> <br>I decided to test my strength to see if it was even possible. I tugged on Frank&#x2019;s bloated and callused feet, feet that I had come to loathe&#x2014;why do you have to tell a grown man to clip his toenails? I dragged the body about a foot from his landing site before I gave up. Frank had put on weight in the past year, but even if he were svelte I couldn&#x2019;t see depositing him anyplace where he&#x2019;d never be found. And now there was a suspicious trail of blood in the shape of a question mark just above his head. I might be able to explain it away if I called the police and stayed put. But then they&#x2019;d start looking at me real carefully and I didn&#x2019;t like people looking at me all that much.<br> <br>I tried to imagine my trial. Me, scrubbed clean, hair pulled back in a schoolmarm bun, wearing an innocent flowered sundress with a Peter Pan collar, trying to look not guilty, with my hard-edged poker face dry as the desert. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how I&#x2019;d summon tears or sell that shattered look of loss. I can&#x2019;t show much emotion anymore. That was something Frank always liked about me. There was a time I used to cry, but that was another lifetime ago. My heart was broken just once. But completely.<br> <br>As I sat in Frank&#x2019;s chair, nursing my drink, I pretended to be weighing my options. But there was only one.<br> <br>Frank kept his gambling stash in his toolbox. A little over twelve hundred dollars. I packed for a short trip and loaded the suitcase into the back of Frank&#x2019;s Chevy pickup.<br> <br>I was only leaving two people behind, if you don&#x2019;t count Frank: Carol from the bar and Dr. Mike.<br> <br>Dr. Mike was the top chiropractor in Waterloo, Wisconsin. There were only two, so it wasn&#x2019;t much of a competition. He&#x2019;d taken over the practice three years ago, when Dr. Bill retired. Ever since the accident, my back hasn&#x2019;t been right. Dr. Bill used to fix me up once or twice a month. I saw Dr. Mike more frequently. The first time he put his hands on me, I felt an electric jolt, like I had woken up for the first time in years. I came back the next week and it was the exact same thing. I came back the week after that. I missed a week and Dr. Mike dropped by the bar to see how I was doing. Frank was on a fishing trip and Dr. Mike offered to give me an adjustment in the back office. It didn&#x2019;t go as planned.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t trouble Carol at this hour. I&#x2019;d wake her kids. Maybe I&#x2019;d send her a postcard from the road.<br> <br>My chiropractor worked out of an office on the first floor of his three-story Queen Anne&#x2013;style house in the nice part of town. The smart thing to do was to get out now, run during those precious hours when the world thought Frank was still in it. But I had few real connections to this world, and Dr. Mike was one of them.<br> <br>I drove Frank&#x2019;s Chevy truck to Dr. Mike&#x2019;s house and took the key from under the rock. I unlocked the door and entered his bedroom. Dr. Mike made a purring sound when he was in a deep sleep, just like a Siamese cat I had as a child. He kind of moved like one, too. He always stretched his lanky limbs upon waking, alternating between slow and deliberate, and fast and sharp. I took off my clothes and climbed into bed next to him.<br> <br>Dr. Mike woke up, wrapping his arms around me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you need an adjustment?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was our little joke. He kissed my neck and then my lips and he turned onto his back, waiting for me to start. That was his thing; we never did it unless it was my decision. I had started it, I&#x2019;d continue it, and today I was ending it.<br> <br>Dr. Mike and I were never a great love story. He was the place I went to when I wanted to forget. When I was with Dr. Mike I forgot about Frank, I forgot about running from the law, I forgot about who I used to be.<br> <br>When we were done, Mike was massaging the kinks out of my back and trying to straighten out my spine.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re completely out of alignment. Did something happen? Did you do something you shouldn&#x2019;t have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Dr. Mike turned me over on my back and said, &#x201c;Something has changed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d felt like a speck of dust frozen in an ice cube for far too long. I should have done something about this life I had long before Dead Frank made me do something.<br> <br>I looked at the clock; it was just past midnight. Time to leave. I got dressed quickly.<br> <br>Dr. Mike studied me with a professional regard. &#x201c;This is the end, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how he knew, but he did. There was no point in answering the question.<br> <br>&#x201c;In the next few days, you might hear some things about me. I just want you to know that they&#x2019;re not true. Later, it&#x2019;s possible you&#x2019;ll hear more things about me. Most of them won&#x2019;t be true either,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I kissed him good-bye for the last time.<br> <br>I DROVE thirty miles before I gassed up the truck. I had one ATM card and one credit card and withdrew the $200 maximum for each. I drove another twenty miles to the next fuel stop, got a strong cup of coffee, and withdrew another two hundred on each card. Frank had always been stingy with our money. I had one credit card and a small bank account and neither provided sufficient funds to set you up, if you decided to take an extended vacation. I made one more stop at a Quick Mart, got another four hundred dollars, and dropped the cards in the Dumpster out back. I had $2,400 and a Chevy truck that I&#x2019;d have to lose before long. I should have been tucking money away from the moment I got the key to the cash register. I should have known this day would come.<br> <br>The truck smelled like my husband&#x2014;my ex-husband? Or was I a widow? I&#x2019;d have to decide. I guess I could have never married. Either way, I drove with the windows open, trying to lose the scent of Frank.<br> <br>I merged onto I-39 South, leaving Wisconsin behind. I drove through Illinois for some time until I saw a sign for I-80, which I knew would take me somewhere. I had no destination in mind, so I headed west, mostly because I didn&#x2019;t feel like squinting against the morning light. And I planned on driving through dawn.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t brought music for the drive, so I was stuck with local radio and preachers all night long. I hooked onto a station while speeding along the rolling hills of Iowa. It was too dark to see the denuded trees and murky snow marring the barren February landscape.<br> <br>The Iowa preacher who kept me company for the first half of my journey was listing the seven signs of the Antichrist. One was that he&#x2019;d appear Christlike. I listened through the static of the fading station and noted a few more clues. He&#x2019;d be handsome and charming. He was sounding like a catch. But then I lost reception. So it&#x2019;s quite possible I&#x2019;ll run into the Antichrist and never know it.<br> <br>I toggled through the stations to another minister preaching about forgiveness. It&#x2019;s a subject that doesn&#x2019;t interest me. I switched off the radio and drove to the sound of wind swishing by and wheels on asphalt while headlights of people on a different path blinked and vanished in my peripheral vision.<br> <br>I remembered the day I met Frank. I had only been in town a few weeks, hoping to land work somewhere. I was drinking at his bar, which was named after him. Dubois&#x2019;. Sometimes I think I married Frank for his name. I never liked Tanya Pitts. Didn&#x2019;t like the first name, didn&#x2019;t like the last name. No doubt, Tanya Dubois was a promotion.<br> <br>Back then, Frank had some life in him and I had none, so it worked out just fine. He gave me my first real job. I learned how to pull pints and mix drinks, although we didn&#x2019;t get too many requests for cocktails in our humble establishment. There wasn&#x2019;t much more to my life with Frank. We didn&#x2019;t have any children. I made sure of that.<br> <br>After driving all night, I found myself just outside Lincoln, Nebraska. It was time to take a break and lose the truck. I found a used car dealership and traded in Frank&#x2019;s two-year-old Chevy Silverado for a seven-year-old Buick Regal and seventeen hundred in cash. I knew I was being fleeced, but it was better not to draw attention to myself. I wouldn&#x2019;t be keeping the Buick for long, anyway. I drove another ten miles to a small town called Milford and found a motel called Motel that looked like the kind of establishment that wouldn&#x2019;t mind an all-cash transaction. When they asked for ID, I said I&#x2019;d lost mine. I paid a surcharge and signed the register as Jane Green.<br> <br>I slept for eight solid hours. If I were guilty, could I have done that? I woke with a hunger so fierce it had turned to nausea. I opened the door of room 14, on the second story of the stucco building, and leaned over the balcony to catch a glimpse of the town where I&#x2019;d landed. I don&#x2019;t think that balcony was up to code. I took a step back, spotted an unlit red neon sign for DINER.<br> <br>I returned to my room, washed up, and headed out, giving myself a quick reminder: You are Jane Green for now. Forget who you used to be.<br> <br>It was eight in the evening, well past the dinner crowd, so I took a seat in a booth, figuring the counter is where everyone talks. I probably wouldn&#x2019;t be very good at that, since I had no identity. That would come later.<br> <br>A waitress named Carla dropped a menu in front of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I start you off with anything?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coffee,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Black.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Try it first; then decide.&#x201d; She poured the coffee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a minute to look over the menu.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was right. It wasn&#x2019;t the kind of coffee you drank straight. I drowned it in cream and sugar. Even then it was hard to keep down. I perused the menu, trying to decide what I was in the mood for. It occurred to me that Jane Green might be in the mood for something different than Tanya Dubois. But since I hadn&#x2019;t yet changed my clothes or my hair, I could probably last another day eating the food that Tanya liked. Jane Green was just a shell I embodied before I could be reborn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you decided, sweetheart?&#x201d; Carla asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Apple pie and French fries,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl after my own heart,&#x201d; Carla said, swiftly walking away on her practical white nurse&#x2019;s shoes.<br> <br>I watched Carla chat with a trucker who was hunched over a plate of meatloaf at the end of the counter. He grumbled something I couldn&#x2019;t understand.<br> <br>Carla squinted with a determined earnestness and said, &#x201c;Sunshine, I think you need to go on antidepressants. Yes indeed, you need a happy pill. The next time you walk into my house I want to see a smile on that handsome face of yours. Do you hear me? See that sign there? We have the right to refuse service.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Carla, leave the poor man alone,&#x201d; some guy in the kitchen yelled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mind your own business, Duke,&#x201d; Carla said. Then she filled more cups of coffee, called customers honey and sweetheart, and belly-laughed at a joke that wasn&#x2019;t funny at all. I thought it would be nice to be Carla, maybe just for a little while. Try her on and see if she fit.<br> <br>I devoured my pie and French fries so quickly even Carla was impressed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen three-hundred-pound truckers put food away that fast. You must have been famished.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. Short answers. Always.<br> <br>I paid the check and left, walking down the dull drag of the small town, which hardly deserved a name. I walked into a drugstore and purchased shampoo, a toothbrush, toothpaste, hair dye in auburn and dark brown, and a disposable cell phone from behind the counter.<br> <br>The clerk, a middle-aged man with the name Gordon on his name tag, rang up my order and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be fifty-eight dollars and thirty-four cents.&#x201d;<br> <br>I paid in cash. As I was leaving, the following words escaped my mouth: &#x201c;Thanks, sweetheart. Have a nice day.&#x201d;<br> <br>It felt so wrong, I almost shivered in embarrassment.<br> <br>I FOUND a liquor store on the way home and purchased a bottle of Frank&#x2019;s favorite bourbon. I figured I could drink away all my memories. I paid in cash and said a mere &#x201c;thanks&#x201d; to the clerk.<br> <br>Back in the hotel room, with the heating unit rattling out of time, I spread my bounty on the bed and tried to decide my next move. I&#x2019;d known it all along, but I didn&#x2019;t yet have the courage. I took a shot of bourbon and plucked my phone book from my purse. I inhaled and practiced saying hello a few times. Then I dialed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver and Mead Construction,&#x201d; the receptionist said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to speak to Mr. Roland Oliver.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;May I ask who is calling?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. But I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll want to talk to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please hold.&#x201d;<br> <br>A click, and then Beethoven blasted over the line. Two full minutes passed and the receptionist returned.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid Mr. Oliver is very busy right now. Can I take a number, and he&#x2019;ll call you back?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to say the name, but I didn&#x2019;t see any other way of reaching him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell Mr. Oliver that his old friend Tanya is calling.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time I got only a few bars of Beethoven before Mr. Oliver&#x2019;s deep sandpaper voice came on the line.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tanya Pitts,&#x201d; I whispered.<br> <br>He said nothing. I could hear his labored breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need your help,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have called me here,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would it have been better if I left a message with your wife?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A favor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of favor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need a new name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with the one you&#x2019;ve got?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not working for me anymore. I think you know someone who can take care of these things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I might.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a clean identity, a name that&#x2019;s prettier than my old one, and if possible, I wouldn&#x2019;t mind being a few years younger.&#x201d; Tanya Dubois was about to have her thirtieth birthday. But I didn&#x2019;t want to turn thirty before my time.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get identities served to order,&#x201d; Mr. Oliver said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do your best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I reach you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll reach you.

Fans and newcomers alike will be rewarded by his incisive eye for character and his ability to deliver a relentless and engaging narrative -- always in the service of his inimitable style.</p><p><em>The Darling</em> is Hannah Musgrave's story, told emotionally and convincingly years later by Hannah herself. A political radical and member of the Weather Underground, Hannah has fled America to West Africa, where she and her Liberian husband become friends and colleagues of Charles Taylor, the notorious warlord and now ex-president of Liberia. When Taylor leaves for the United States in an effort to escape embezzlement charges, he's immediately placed in prison. Hannah's encounter with Taylor in America ultimately triggers a series of events whose momentum catches Hannah's family in its grip and forces her to make a heartrending choice.</p><p>Set in Liberia and the United States from 1975 through 1991, <em>The Darling</em> is a political-historical thriller -- reminiscent of Greene and Conrad -- that explodes the genre, raising serious philosophical questions about terrorism, political violence, and the clash of races and cultures.</p></p><p>Russell Banks brings to life in <i>The Darling</i> another political-historical narrative of great scope and range. As in <i>Continental Drift</i> and <i>Rule of the Bone</i>, racial issues are explored; as in <i>Cloudsplitter</i>, idealism runs off the rails. Banks always makes it work because he keeps it real.<p> The "darling" of the story is Dawn Carrington, ne� Hannah Musgrave, a political radical and member of the Weather Underground forced to flee America to avoid arrest. At the time of the novel, she is 59, living on her working farm in upstate New York with four younger women, recalling her life in Liberia and her recent return to that country to look for her sons. "Mainly, we return to a place in order to learn why we left," she says. For Hannah, the decision was harrowing. She abandoned her sons during a bloody civil war, after the death of her husband, Woodrow Sundiata, a black African Cabinet Minister in President Samuel Doe's government, who is beheaded in front of her and her three boys. Banks explores mercilessly the corruption, greed, sloth, cynicism, and violence running through the Liberian leaders from Tolbert to Doe to Charles Taylor, weaving the real story of the horrors of West Africa with the fictional narrative of Hannah and Woodrow. He can take history off the page, bringing to life the times, people and events he recounts.</p><p> Hannah was born a child of privilege and chafed against it from her youth: "...it was an old impulse ... this desire to separate myself in the dance of life from the people who had brought me and become one instead with the people excluded from the dance..." Her father is a famous pediatrician, her mother a shadow figure maintaining a predictably correct suburban household. Both parents are liberal, but Hannah outstrips their political stance early on. They are estranged for many years because of her flight, but the separation is really much deeper than distance or politics. </p><p> She becomes a wife and mother, and is bored and unfulfilled by the role. She turns to creating a sanctuary for chimpanzees and finds her real purpose. "An old pattern. It's how since childhood I have made my daily life worth living, by turning tedium and despair into a cause." She names each chimp, calls them her "dreamers," and cares for them while others care for her children. Self-knowledge is not high on a list of her personal attributes. Although she characterizes herself as "a darling," there is little evidence to support her claim: distant father, cold mother, controlling husband. She finally sees herself in a true light: "Here it all was again: the names and dates, the tired facts of my biography up to then, the description of my few skills and talents. It was the CV of a small-time, would-be domestic terrorist. Sad. Pathetic." Hannah Musgrave is a visitor in her own life, never really connecting with anyone; more a dreamer than a darling. </p><p> Russell Banks has, once again in <i>The Darling</i>, shown himself to be one of the finest novelists writing today. He has written very convincingly, in a woman's voice, a story of youthful idealism destroyed by the real world, of a woman who connected more completely with chimps than with humans, and who says, "once it was clear to me that I would have to abandon my husband and children and return alone to the United States, once I saw that I would be alone, safe from prosecution--I realized, gradually at first and then in a rush, that it was exactly what I had wanted all along... I was once again seizing an opportunity to abandon one life for another." Another reinvention for Hannah. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>In <b>The Darling</b>, Russell Banks -- internationally acclaimed as America's most powerful novelist today -- has surpassed himself with an unforgettable and brilliant new novel about Africa, passion and the human condition. <br> <br>Hannah Musgrave has had to flee her native America as she is wanted for her radical political activities associated with the Weather Underground. Arriving in West Africa in the mid-seventies she marries a government official and her life charts a new course as political unrest becomes the order of the day in her new home of Liberia. As narrator, the white, middle-class Hannah, navigates us through an African nation's struggle for identity as well as her own. <br> <br>Hannah and her husband, are friends and colleagues of Charles Taylor, the notorious warlord. Taylor flees to the US on embezzlement charges, where he's tossed in a prison, from which, with Hannah's help, he manages to escape. <br> <br>Returning to Africa, after getting arms and support in Libya, Taylor foments a bloody rebellion. Hannah, awaiting her chance to aid in the overthrow attempt, establishes a chimpanzee sanctuary. Then in the late 1980s Hannah and her family get caught up in the civil war, her husband is killed by government agents, and her now teenaged sons join the rebels to avenge their father. As an American who's offered safe haven by the US embassy and a flight home, she faces a heart rending choice: abandon her sons and her beloved chimps or stay and go down with them.</p><h2>The Life of the Buddha: According to the Pali Canon</h2><p>Composed entirely of texts from the Pali canon, this unique biography presents the oldest authentic record of the Buddha s life and revolutionary philosophy. The ancient texts are rendered here in a language marked by lucidity and dignity, and a framework of narrators and voices connect the canonical texts. Vivid recollections of his personal attendant Ananda and other disciples bring the reader into the Buddha s presence, where his example offers profound inspiration and guidance on the path to freedom.<br></p><p>The Life of the Buddha: According to the Pali Canon was first published in 1972 by the Buddhist Publication Society in Sri Lanka. BPS Pariyatti Editions is pleased to republish this esteemed book for the first time in the Americas and reach a new and wider audience seeking original material from the Buddha's teachings. <p>Bhikkhu Nanamoli, translator and arranger of this work, was one of the first Englishmen to embrace Buddhism. He created a unique framework of narrators to tell the story of the Buddha's life, suggested by the material itself, which was originally recited. As the Pali scholar R.W. Rhys Davids noted, during his long life and career as a teacher the Buddha had ample time to repeat the principals and details of the system to his disciples, and to test their knowledge, so that great reliance may be placed upon the doctrinal parts of the Buddhist Scriptures. </p><p>This account of the Buddha's life and times provides rich context for his teaching, illuminating the compassion, loving kindness, wisdom and other exceptional qualities that informed his actions and interactions. As such it offers profound inspiration for all.</p><b>Bhikkhu �anamoli</b> was ordained as a monk in Sri Lanka, where he spent 11 years living in a monastery and translating the texts of Theravada Buddhism into English.

Many believe that historical grievances must eventually be left behind in the interest of progress toward a more just and unified society. But too much in American history is unforgivable and cannot be forgotten. How then can we imagine a way to live together that does not expect people to let go of their entrenched resentments?<br><br><i>Living with Hate in American Politics and Religion</i> offers an innovative argument for the power of playfulness in popular culture to make our capacity for coexistence imaginable. Jeffrey Israel explores how people from different backgrounds can pursue justice together, even as they play with their divisive grudges, prejudices, and desires in their cultural lives. Israel calls on us to distinguish between what belongs in a raucous &#x201c;domain of play&#x201d; and what belongs in the domain of the political. He builds on the thought of John Rawls and Martha Nussbaum to defend the liberal tradition against challenges posed by Frantz Fanon from the left and Leo Strauss from the right. In provocative readings of Lenny Bruce&#x2019;s stand-up comedy, Philip Roth&#x2019;s <i>Portnoy&#x2019;s Complaint</i>, and Norman Lear&#x2019;s <i>All in the Family</i>, Israel argues that postwar Jewish American popular culture offers potent and fruitful examples of playing with fraught emotions. <i>Living with Hate in American Politics and Religion</i> is a powerful vision of what it means to live with others without forgiving or forgetting.</p><p>Jeffrey Israel is an associate professor in the Department of Religion and the Jewish Studies Program at Williams College.<br><br>Martha C. Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago. She is the author of many books, most recently <i>The Monarchy of Fear: A Philosopher Looks at Our Political Crisis</i> (2018), and the winner of the 2018 Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture.How can a more perfect American union be attained given our legacy of historical group injustices and corresponding enduring group antagonisms? In this brilliantly original synthesis of insights from political philosophy, moral psychology, and Jewish American humor, Jeffrey Israel argues that through 'play'&#x2015;not a facile (and unachievable) national Kumbaya reconciliation, but a reenacting of grudges in a bracketed psychological space backgrounding the political&#x2015;we can at least come to live with each other in a way that recognizes our common vulnerable humanity. (Charles W. Mills, author of <i>Black Rights/White Wrongs: The Critique of Racial Liberalism</i>)<br><br>In the post-World War II era, Jews, many of them the children of immigrants, moved into a prominent place in the production of the nation's popular culture and sought to make sense of their relationship with the many other kinds of Americans with whom they shared their society. Drawing on a deep and nuanced understanding of this history, Jeffrey Israel makes a compelling case for the importance of play in allowing Americans to live together. (Hasia Diner, author of <i>We Remember with Reverence and Love: American Jews and the Myth of Silence after the Holocaust, 1945&#x2013;1962</i>)<br><br>Jeffrey Israel has written an amazing book. He wants us to love America in a distinctly political register that ties our individual flourishing to the flourishing of every compatriot. Political love is essential to realizing the promise of justice. But he knows that political love must live alongside historically rooted animosities that deeply divide us. Israel squares this apparent circle with <i>play.</i> In play, we give full-throated voice to our animosities: we engage them, with no thought of transcending them. Seems too good to be true? Start with the beautiful chapter on Lenny Bruce, and then go for a great ride. (Joshua Cohen, author of <i>The Arc of the Moral Universe and Other Essays</i>)<br><br>Reality might fall short of the ideal, but Jeffrey Israel does not. <i>Living with Hate in American Politics and Religion</i> is so wonderfully fluid that it feels as though Israel is reading a scholarly bedtime story.

It examines the promotion of the character through radio premiums and merchandising from the late 1930&#39;s to the mid-1970&#39;s. It covers &#34;The Lone Ranger&#39;s&#34; continued growth as a television success beginning in the late 1940&#39;s, the production of two motion pictures in the late 1950&#39;s, the Lone Ranger&#39;s last first-run &#34;Hi-Yo, Silver!&#34; as a Saturday morning television cartoon series in the 1960&#39;s, and the character&#39;s 1970&#39;s resurgence of popularity in radio and television reruns all over the world. In addition to being a definitive work on &#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; property, the book provides the reader with a &#34;behind-the-mike&#34; view of early radio drama, and a &#34;behind-the camera&#34; view of television filmmaking during the 1950&#39;s. One hundred and seventy pictures - many of them rare photographs from the radio days - provide visual memories. Another highlight of the book is the inclusion of the complete script from the first Lone Ranger radio program. In addition, Lone Ranger Television, Inc. (a subsidiary of Wrather Corporation) has dug into its archives to provide the author with fascinating background information concerning the development of &#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; property through the years. They have also made available many never-before-published photographs from the television and motion picture years.</p><p></p><h2>In the Shadow of the Alabama: The British Foreign Office and the American Civil War (New Perspectives on Maritime History and Nautical Archaeolog)</h2><p>This book looks at an allegation of betrayal made against a young Foreign Office clerk, Victor Buckley, who, it was claimed, leaked privileged information to agents of the southern States during the American Civil War. As a consequence, the CSS <i>Alabama</i> narrowly escaped seizure by the British government and proceeded to wage war on American shipping. Victor Buckley's background is examined against the hitherto erroneous belief that he was an insignificant member of the foreign office staff.<br><p>The American minister Charles Francis Adams oversees a network of spies endeavoring to prove contravention of The Foreign Enlistment Act. The South's agents, Captain James D. Bulloch and Major Caleb Huse, are the prime targets, and a battle of wits ensues as Bulloch oversees construction of his ships on Merseyside. <br></p><p>A member of a prominent City family offers to enlist the help of a relative who, he claims, holds a confidential position in the Foreign Office. The Confederate agents are soon receiving information about the status of Anglo-American diplomacy and are able to outwit the Union spies and dispatch arms and supplies to the South. Their coup d'�tat is achieved with the arrival of a message that hurries the Confederate's most formidable warship out of British waters.<br></p><p>After the escape of the <i>Alabama</i>, the government moves to curtail Bulloch's operations. When the war ends in 1865, investigations begin into the circumstances surrounding the <i>Alabama</i>'s departure. As America demands reparation, evidence apparently incriminating Victor Buckley is acquired, but before the claim reaches its hearing in Geneva, diplomatic moves (some involving Anglo-American Masonic influence) result in a treaty and ensure that no allegation is made against any individual member of foreign office staff. Queen Victoria, anxious to see the <i>Alabama</i> claims settled, is spared embarrassment.<br></p><p>A scandal erupts in the foreign office in 1878 as a freelance clerk, Charles Marvin, leaks sensitive information to the press and subsequently writes of his experiences, revealing much of the ethos of the office pertinent to Buckley's story. The writer Arthur Conan Doyle becomes fascinated by Anglo-American diplomacy and the <i>Alabama</i> question, and, soon after joining a London gentlemen's club where Buckley's alleged contact is a member, writes a Sherlock Holmes story involving a Foreign Office clerk's apparent betrayal. <br></p><p>Coincidentally, Conan Doyle has been acquainted with Buckley's associate some years earlier, and he soon makes a thinly veiled appearance in a fictional work by England's most famous crime writer.</p><p></p></p><p>Renata Eley Long is a freelance writer and historian who has lived and worked on both sides of the Atlantic. Her childhood in Cornwall and Bristol fostered an early interest in maritime history that developed into a passion for research and unearthing the untold stories of the past."Long's work is exceptionally well researched in terms of details regarding the British government's inner workings during the time of the American Civil War and for a few years surround the period. She has done a remarkable service to the historiography of the American Civil War, particularly the international relations element, by adding this wealth of insight to the scholarship." -- <i><b>U.S. Military History Review</b></i><br><br>"<i>In the Shadow of the Alabama</i> is written with a refreshing lack of academic jargon. Long is a freelance writer-historian whose book-jacket bio lists no academic credit. One hopes that the comment 'writes like a novelist' wouldn't be an insult; most historical novelists would love to write as well."<b><i>--America's Civil War</i></b><br><br>"Why is the <i>Alabama</i> claims case still worthy of study and this book still relevant? Despite advances in technology since the time of the Civil war, diplomatic histories give a reader insight into the inner workings of foreign relations, which haven't really changed that much since then. And of course, the citizens and even governments of ostensibly neutral nations will always find compelling reasons to interfere in other nations' wars, and with that in mind, Long has written an intricately-crafted cautionary tale."<b><i>--The Daybook,</i> Hampton Roads Naval Museum</b><br><br>"This is a very readable synthesis of an extremely important episode in Anglo-American history. Specialists will revisit familiar events and be pleased to have a reliable and up-to-date account. <i>In the Shadow of the Alabama</i> follows the 'traditional' interpretation of British views of the American Civil War established in the 1920s, accepting British elite support for the Confederacy and working class support for the Union, overlooking recent, more complicated interpretations. It is a nice addition to the field."<b><i>--International Journal of Maritime History</i></b><br><br>"The author has done a good job to bring the times and people to life in what was really a cat-and-mouse game--but a game with deadly results."<b><i>--Sea Classics</i></b><br><br>"The mysteries surrounding the <i>Alabama</i> are explored in this new book. There are a number of them and each is given a thorough look, allowing the reader an in-depth look at the political machinations of the American and British governments at a critical time in their relations. The involvement of the British in the American Civil War is full of intrigue, and this story of the vessel is a fascinating tale well presented."<i><b>--Military Heritage</b></i><br><br>"This new examination of Buckley's role as a possible Foreign Office mole is Long's greatest contribution to the literature on British supporters of the Confederacy. More germane is the impressive variety of rare and in some cases heretofore unused personal accounts and memoirs Long has uncovered, including privately printed internal histories of the British arms companies that supplied the Confederacy and the memoir of British Confederate sympathizer M. J. Butcher."<b>--H-Net.org</b><br><br>"Long's story is at its best when framing the struggle that went into creating the special relationship between Great Britain and the United States."<b>--JAMP (<i>Journal of America's Military Past</i>)</b><br><br>"<i>In the Shadow of the Alabama</i> contributes to the growing literature on Civil War diplomacy though its interesting profiles of sometimes obscure figures and useful survey of Anglo-American interactions over shipbuilding and arms distribution." --<b><i>Michigan War Studies Review</i></b><br><br>"This is a worthwhile read, a detective adventure overlaid by multiple layers of mystery."<b><i>--The Northern Mariner</i></b></p><h2>ENTRANCED (Donovan Legacy)</h2><p>Entranced by Nora Roberts released on May 25, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Nora Roberts is the bestselling author of more than two hundred romance novels.

It&#39;s more than a compliment or a pat on the back. According to Drs. Larry Crabb and Dan Allender, it is the most basic form of counseling -- a skill that can be mastered by laypeople as well as counselors. What must we know in order to fulfill the biblical exhortation to &#39;encourage one another&#39;? Encouragement: The Key to Caring tells you. Part one deals with understanding encouragement, and part two explores the process of encouragement, including such practical how-tos as - developing a careful selection of encouraging words - cultivating active listening skills - using biblical fellowship to move beyond superficial smiles and shallow greetings - recognizing subtle opportunities for encouragement -- Without the encouragement of a caring community, biblical truth taught in church tends to just thicken people&#39;s defense layers. But authenticity, freedom, and greater love for God and others are the fruit of encouragement, and evidence of the tremendous power God invests in individuals and churches who practice it.</p><p>Dr. Larry Crabb, Ph.D., is a well-known speaker, author of numerous best-selling books including God of My Father, Finding God, and Men and Women, and Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence at Colorado Christian University in Morrison.

After she and her husband got married, they moved to Gainesville, Florida to operate a music store. It was also about this time that Barbara was learning the frailing style on the banjo (the old-time mountain style). She was studying with Eric Muller, the banjo instructor at her store, but there was a lack of instructional material for the frailing style. <p>At a National Association of Music Merchants convention around 1974, Barbara and Mr. Muller met Mel Bay and asked if he had any books on frailing style. There were none at the time, so Mr. Bay suggested they write one. Barbara and Eric Muller then collaborated on their first title, Frailing the 5-String Banjo. This was one of Mel Bay Publications' first books to contain extensive photographs of folk musicians in their natural setting. George Heaps-Nelson was the harmonica teacher at the the Koehler's store while working in Ph.D. in Latin American History.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>. (Ages 8 to 13) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The beloved first book of the Harry Potter series, now fully illustrated by award-winning artist Jim Kay. For the first time, J. K. Rowling&#39;s beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Rowling herself selected artist Jim Kay, whose over 100 illustrations make this deluxe format as perfect a gift for the child being introduced to the series as for the dedicated fan. Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#39;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#39;t had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.</p><h2>Las Vegas Babylon: True Tales of Glitter, Glamour, and Greed</h2><p>Las Vegas Babylon is a lively, photo-filled, and entertaining compilation of stories chronicling decades of celebrity scandals, mobsters, true crimes, and decadence in the most notoriously sinful city in the world. Using new information from recently released FBI documents, Burbank brings to life the Vegas mob in its hey-day, recounting never before heard tales of the Vegas mobsters who made Vegas what is today.</p><p>Jeff Burbank is an award-winning news reporter whose work has appeared in numerous American publications. He lives in Las Vegas.Vegas-based reporter Burbank aims to cut through the hype that surrounds the country's top tourist Mecca and reveal-in addition to the usual tales of excess and self-destruction-the "seriously malfunctioning society beneath the 'It's Vegas, baby!' fa�ade." Part gossip smorgasbord, part cautionary tale, the book speeds through the city's century-long history, from its mob-dominated early flourishing to the less murderous but still sleazy local politics scene. (Where else are elected officials busted by the FBI in a topless club bribery investigation codenamed "G-Sting?") Burbank has taken his cue (and his title) from Kenneth Anger's iconic Hollywood Babylon, but this work has less of Anger's over-the-top cantankerous style, �ber-insider posturing and lurid details-it's more of a journalistic reckoning than a dark counter-myth of its own. A large chunk of the book is taken up by a catalogue of Vegas celebrity lore, dishing grand scandals like JFK's troubled affair with a mob moll alongside ridiculous fluff, such as a P.R. confrontation between Robin Leach and Emeril Lagasse over whipped-cream-smothered party girls. Burbank's doggedly contrarian stance is his main asset, and he has thought-provoking points to make on the drastic social and environmental costs of poorly-regulated city expansion and the monopolized local media. It might not attain the cult-classic status of its Hollywood namesake, but readers will enjoy a well-researched volume of lively stories about a city that turned 100 this year, and, like a chintzy lounge singer, shows no signs of slowing down.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in Redondo Beach, California.Grade 3-5?This book covers the six days surrounding the sinking of the Titanic, as seen through the eyes of two survivors: 17-year-old Jack Thayer, a passenger, and Harold Bride, the 22-year-old assistant wireless operator. With fictionalized words and feelings attributed to these actual historical figures, the text has a slightly stilted feel to it. Facts and details about the ship are sometimes awkwardly inserted into Jack's experiences, especially during the first part of the book. But overall, the fictionalization works fairly well. Jack observes details that give immediacy to the disaster and the people involved. As the story progresses towards the catastrophe, it is hard not to get caught up in the tension. By the time of the actual shipwreck, readers know Jack pretty well, as well as a few other passengers, so the tragedy has a personal impact beyond the sheer numbers. Numerous full-color and black-and-white diagrams, historical photographs and drawings, and original paintings help bring the voyage to life. Technical flaws that contributed to the tragedy are woven neatly into the text and diagrams. Robert Ballard's Exploring the Titanic (Scholastic, 1988) is more fascinating, and Deborah Kent's The Titanic (Childrens, 1993) gives a drier, more straightforward account, while Daisy Spedden's Polar the Titanic Bear (Little, 1994) offers a more fanciful fictionalized version.

LINCOLN: The Story of America&#39;s Most Reviled President</h2><p>Today, Abraham Lincoln is a beloved American icon, widely considered to be our best president. It was not always so. Larry Tagg&#x2019;s The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln is the first study of its kind to concentrate on what Lincoln&#x2019;s contemporaries actually thought of him during his lifetime. Be forewarned: your preconceived notions are about to be shattered.<br><br>Torn by civil war, the era in which our sixteenth president lived and governed was the most rough-and-tumble in the history of American politics. The violence of the criticism aimed at Lincoln by the great men of his time on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line is simply startling. Indeed, the breadth and depth of the spectacular prejudice against him is often shocking for its cruelty, intensity, and unrelenting vigor. The plain truth is that Mr. Lincoln was deeply reviled by many who knew him personally, and by hundreds of thousands who only knew of him.<br><br>Boisterous and venomous enough to be good entertainment, The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln rests upon a wide foundation of research that includes years of searching through contemporary newspapers. Tagg includes extensive treatment of the political context that begat Lincoln&#x2019;s predicament, riding with the president to Washington, and walking with him through the bleak years of war and up to and beyond assassination. Throughout, Tagg entertains with a lively writing style, outstanding storytelling verve, and an unconventional, against-the-grain perspective that is sure to delight readers of all stripes.<br><br>Lincoln&#x2019;s humanity has been unintentionally trivialized by some historians and writers who have hidden away the real man in a patina of bronze. Once readers learn the truth of how others viewed him, they will better understand the man he was, and how history is better viewed through a long-distance lens than contemporaneously.<br><br>The bicentennial of Lincoln&#x2019;s birth will be celebrated in 2009 and will be the biggest year ever for public interest in Abraham Lincoln. The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission created and funded by Congress will &#x201c;inform the public about the impact Abraham Lincoln had on the development of our nation.&#x201d; The year will also witness the release of Steven Spielberg&#x2019;s long-awaited movie on President Lincoln. Of all the Lincoln books slated for publication, The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln will be the &#x201c;must-read&#x201d; title for general readers and scholars alike.<br><br>About the Author: Born in Lincoln, Illinois, Larry Tagg graduated from the University of Texas at Austin.

At its peak, Rosendale's cement industry produced 10 million barrels of natural cement a year, employing 5,000 miners in more than a dozen mines. The creation of artificial cement, however, heralded the end of Rosendale cement. Rosendale rebounded, marketing itself as a "Vacationist Rendezvous." The Catskill and Shawangunk Mountains, the Wallkill River and Rondout Creek, and the region's many mountain houses attracted tens of thousands of visitors each year. Construction of the New York State Thruway in the 1950s led to the demise of Rosendale's booming tourist industry. Today, Joppenbergh Mountain and the trestle bridge stand guard over the town, while Rosendale's many historic buildings and the remnants of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal harken residents and visitors back to an earlier age.</p><p>Gilberto Villahermosa is an internationally published author and proud Rosendale resident.</p><h2>The Elementals</h2><p>"The finest writer of paperback originals in America." - Stephen King <br><br> "Surely one of the most terrifying novels ever written." - Poppy Z.

In this now-classic and profoundly influential study, the <i>New Yorker</i>'s Lawrence Weschler probes these dilemmas across two gripping narratives (set in Brazil and Uruguay, among the first places to face such concerns), true-life thrillers in which torture victims, faced with the paralysis of the new regime, themselves band together to settle accounts with their former tormentors.<br><br>"Disturbing and often enthralling."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Extraordinarily moving. . . . Weschler writes brilliantly."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>Newsday</i><br><br>"Implausible, intricate and dazzling."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"As Weschler's interviewees told their tales, I paced agitatedly, choked back tears. . . . Weschler narrates these two episodes with skill and tact. . . . An inspiring book."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;George Scialabba, <i>Los Angeles Weekly</i></p><p>"When individuals are being tortured and everyone knows about it and no one seems able to do a thing to help," Lawrence Weschler writes, "primordial mysteries at the root of human community come under assault as well." Overthrowing oppressive regimes is not enough to resolve the crisis; the persecutors must also acknowledge what they have done. "True forgiveness is achieved in community.... It is history working itself out as grace, but it can only be accomplished in truth."<p> <i>A Miracle, A Universe</i> brings together two long nonfiction pieces, originally published in the <i>New Yorker</i>, which examine how citizens of Brazil and Uruguay have worked to "settle accounts" with their former torturers. Weschler uses historical background to supplement his powerful eyewitness reportage and interviews, bearing witness to those who seek to break through official denials of government atrocity. The efforts to build a democratic society in which people can have faith have rarely been portrayed with as much immediacy and insight as Weschler brings to these articles.</p>After the demise of Brazil's repressive military regime, a group of ex-prisoners, all former torture victims, banded together to document their captors' atrocities--arbitrary arrests and "disappearances," the torture of thousands, murders. Their 1985 book, which holds the U.S. responsible for helping to create Brazil's dictatorship, became a bestseller in that country. In the first half of his dispassionate report, New Yorker staff writer Wechsler records his conversations with the survivors. Brazil's one-time torturers, he notes, have risen to positions of power. In the book's second half, he describes Uruguay's massive but unsuccessful petition campaign--spearheaded by ex-torture victims and human rights activists--to bring to justice the toppled Uruguayan military regime's butchers. Though Wechsler underestimates the U.S. role in reversing Uruguay's democracy, he points out that the State Department issued bland assurances that the police state in Uruguay was a temporary response to an emergency situation. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Allegiant (Divergent Series, 3)</h2><p>What if your whole world was a lie?<br>What if a single revelation--like a single choice--changed everything?<br>What if love and loyalty made you do things you never expected?<br>The explosive conclusion to Veronica Roth's #1 New York Times bestselling Divergent trilogy reveals the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2013:</strong> Veronica Roth had her work cut out for her, ending a trilogy that had fans rabid for the final book, and she pulled it off like a champ. <i>Allegiant</i> kicks off right where <i>Insurgent</i> ended, so if it&#x2019;s been a while since you read that one you might want to re-read the last couple of chapters to orient yourself. The first surprise in <i>Allegiant</i> is that Roth has switched to using alternating narratives of Tris and Four. At last readers get to see Tris as Four sees her and if, like me, you&#x2019;ve been dying to get inside his head, you finally get your chance. One of the best things about this trilogy is the messy, passionate, and wholly authentic love story between these two.

There are more than eight million copies of his books in print. He lives in Massachusetts with his family.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> With her pen standing in for a drumstick, Jenna Blake tapped out a light but rapid rhythm on the nearly blank sheet of notebook paper in front of her. The previous night, she and her roommate, Yoshiko Kitsuta, had been hanging out in Hunter LaChance's room. Hunter was Yoshiko's boyfriend, and they both insisted it was destiny that put them on the same floor in the same dorm their freshman year at Somerset University. The two had been a couple since the fall, and Jenna was almost willing to believe that maybe it really was destiny between them. The selfish part of her hoped so, because Yoshiko and Hunter were two of her closest friends, and if they broke up, it would ruin a very good thing. </p><p> Her pen rap-tapped on the notebook almost without her being consciously aware of it. But as she kept up the drumbeat, Jenna glanced down at her hand, wondering what the song was that she was so pitifully attempting to play. It might have been something from the new Blessid Union of Souls CD they'd all listened to in Hunter's room last night. Wherever the song had come from, a fragment of its melody had been stuck in her head all day, physical proof of how completely distracted she was. </p><p> But it wasn't just the song that was distracting her. </p><p> No, that had a lot more to do with the fact that this was her last class before spring break officially began. </p><p> <i>And I could use some time away from here,</i> she thought. <i>Somewhere balmy and tropical.</i> </p><p> Jenna recalled with a smile an old TV commercial from when she was a little girl, when a kid came in from playing in the snow and stood in the kitchen door looking pitiful. "Mom," the commercial kid said, "I need it bad." The "it" was a trip to Florida. </p><p> Jenna could totally relate. </p><p> Her left leg bounced rapidly up and down in time to the imaginary rhythm. With some effort, she dropped the pen, planted both feet firmly on the floor, and forced her attention back to Professor Fournier's lecture on sun imagery in Shakespeare's <i>Richard III.</i> It didn't take long for her to realize that -- today, anyway -- she wasn't even the slightest bit interested in what he had to say. All she could think about was that in less than twenty-four hours -- </p><p> <i>Twenty-four hours!</i> </p><p> -- she and Yoshiko would be enjoying their own hot, tropical sun on Captiva Island. </p><p> Several weeks ago, Jenna's roomie had tossed out the suggestion that they go to the Gulf Coast of Florida for spring break. They had talked once about going to Hawaii, where Yoshiko's family still lived, but it was a much longer and more expensive trip, and they wanted to maximize their vacation time. On the other hand, the last thing they wanted was to hit Daytona Beach or somewhere else where college students flashed their bodies for MTV and drank till they puked. That was not the tropical paradise Jenna and Yoshiko had in mind. So, when Yoshiko had brought up the Gulf Coast, Jenna had jumped at the chance. </p><p> Then, almost immediately, she had begun to feel guilty about abandoning her job for more than a week. Leaving campus was one thing. She did have a paper to work on for her medical anthropology class, but she could do that wherever they were. "That's why God made laptops," she told Yoshiko. </p><p> But her job at Somerset Medical Center -- where she worked as a pathology assistant in the office of Dr. Walter Slikowski, the county medical examiner -- didn't just stop when spring break started. The guilt didn't last, though. Particularly once she thought about it and realized that the M.E. would probably fire her if she didn't take spring break for herself. Once she had agreed to go, she found that her excitement and anticipation grew with each passing day. </p><p> Now, just trying to get through the last session of her Shakespeare class before break made her feel as excited as an eight-year-old on Christmas Eve. She found that without realizing it, she had once again begun bouncing her legs and tapping her pen on her notebook. Jenna glanced at the clock on the wall and tried to imagine where she would be by this time tomorrow. </p><p> <i>I'll be covered with sun block, sand, and salt water, that's where I'll be!</i> </p><p> Out of guilt, she had insisted on working after classes today. Later on, she and Yoshiko would finish packing and then go to dinner with Hunter. Afterward, though, she planned to meet her friend Roseanne Kerner and hit a pre-break party at Delta Tau Delta. Jenna normally steered well clear of fraternity parties, but they were planning a clambake, and Roseanne had thought that might be fun. Jenna had her doubts, but it didn't matter. Just spending time with Roseanne was entertaining enough. </p><p> Secretly, she wished that her friend were coming along to Florida as well, but the trip had been Yoshiko's idea, and the two girls didn't really know each other, so Jenna didn't think it was her place to suggest it. Just as she had not invited Hunter and Yoshiko to come along to the DTD party. They would want some time to themselves anyway, and Jenna figured she had a whole week of hanging out with Yoshiko coming up. A night out being goofy with Roseanne was the perfect way to start her break. </p><p> Not too late a night, though. Jenna still had to make the flight out of Logan at eight-thirty the next morning, and she had to be up even earlier because she and Yoshiko were going to see Hunter off on his trip back home to New Orleans. </p><p> <i>You're getting way ahead of yourself, Blake,</i> she thought. <i>You still have this class and a few hours at work to get out of the way.</i> </p><p> Jenna was surprised to find herself thinking about school and work as something to "get out of the way." The truth was, she loved college. It had turned out to be even better than she had expected. The classes were fine...better than fine, actually, but it was her job assisting the county M.E. that most fascinated her. She was confident that she wanted to work in the field of forensics after she graduated. </p><p> But first she had to get through college and medical school, and that meant hanging in there for fifteen more minutes of Shakespeare before she was officially on vacation. The only thing putting a damper on her excitement about spring break was that leaving campus behind meant leaving Danny behind. Danny Mariano was a local police detective Jenna had met through her job with the M.E.'s office. Though he was thirty-two and she was only nineteen, Jenna had developed feelings for Danny. </p><p> Not that there was a lot she could do about them. In her secret heart, she wished that they could overcome the age difference and the fact that they really did exist in two separate worlds. But she knew it just wasn't meant to be. She just had to accept that they were destined to be what Shakespeare called "star cross'd lovers." </p><p> Or maybe she'd just been reading too much Shakespeare and should forget all about Danny for the next week. That's what spring break was for. </p><p> At the moment, though, forgetting Danny was impossible. Several weeks earlier, while working on a homicide investigation, he had been badly burned. He was currently in the rehabilitation unit that was part of Somerset Medical Center, and Jenna visited him often. Whatever other feelings she might have about him, he was her friend, and that was important to her. </p><p> Professor Fournier cleared his throat, interrupting her train of thought. <i>And how dare he? We're only in the middle of his class.</i> Jenna chuckled to herself. </p><p> "Well," the professor said, looking from one student's face to the next, "I can sense that most of you aren't exactly thrilled by this discussion. Spring is in the air, and you have things other than Shakespeare and <i>Richard the Third</i> on your minds." </p><p> When his eyes came to rest on Jenna, she squirmed guiltily in her seat. </p><p> "Go on," Professor Fournier said, clapping his hands together and then waving at them with a shooing motion. "Get out of here. I suspect it's too much to ask of you to finish reading the play over the week's break, but be warned." He shook a finger at them. "When you get back from spring break, we're diving into this play and -- I hope -- some of you will resurface. Go on. Enjoy." </p><p> There was a loud rustling of papers. Books were closed and slid into backpacks, and the students left the classroom in more of a hurry than usual. Jenna found herself at the front of the crowd, pushing out the door. </p><p> Outside, she drew to a stop in the middle of the walkway. Though it was April in New England, the day was surprisingly bright and warm -- a wonderful harbinger of spring. There were still a few traces of a late snowstorm on the ground, but the sky was a cloudless blue, and the air just <i>smelled</i> like spring. The sun beat down warmly on Jenna's upturned face as she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. </p><p> <i>Nice. But this is still New England. Tomorrow I'll be in Florida!</i> </p><p> With a broad grin on her face, she started to hum the tune that had been stuck in her head all day and strode across campus toward the medical center, dreamily watching the hustle and bustle of students going back and forth. </p><p> By the time she crossed Carpenter Street and was on the grounds of the Somerset Medical School and SMC, she had finally gotten that song out of her head. But she kept singing. An old Barenaked Ladies tune, "Brian Wilson," had come to mind, and she bopped along with it as she went down the path in front of the medical center and then up to the second-floor administrative wing. She keyed the door lock and entered the M.E.'s office. Dr. Al Dyson was seated at his cubicle in the outer office. Dyson was the pathology resident currently working with Dr. Slikowski, whom they called Slick, though never to his face. Soft strains of Wynton Marsalis's sweet jazz music drifted through the half-opened door of Slick's interior office. </p><p> Dyson looked up at her with one eyebrow raised, his olive skin somehow seeming even darker than usual, as though he were angry. "What are you doing here?" </p><p> His tone and expression brought Jenna up short. "I -- ah, I thought I was scheduled to work until five." </p><p> She looked around when Slick's office door swung open, and he propelled his wheelchair into the outer office. He looked surprised, at first, to see her there. Then his features turned grim. </p><p> "Miss Blake, may I ask you a question?" </p><p> Jenna smiled a bit nervously and shrugged. "Sure." </p><p> He removed his glasses and regarded her tiredly. "How long do you think I could stand looking at you with such a pale complexion?" </p><p> Jenna was momentarily confused. Then Dyson snickered, and she caught on. </p><p> "What I mean," Slick continued as he replaced his glasses, "is that I don't need your services today, and I don't want to see you here again until you have a nice, dark tan." </p><p> "You mean I can go?" </p><p> Slick and Dyson exchanged amused glances. </p><p> "See?" the M.E. said. "I <i>told</i> you she was <i>brilliant."</i> </p><p> "When you're right, you're right," Dyson agreed. He turned to wink at Jenna. </p><p> "Now scoot before I change my mind," Slick told her. </p><p> <i>Scoot,</i> Jenna thought. Who says <i>"scoot" anymore?</i> </p><p> But that was part of Slick's charm. He was still in his forties, but his behavior sometimes made him seem much older. </p><p> Slick smiled. "I suspect that Dr. Dyson and I can hold this department together without you for a week. Do you think?" </p><p> "Probably not much longer than that, though," Dyson added dryly. </p><p> "True," Slick said, nodding sagely. "Not to put too fine a point to it, Jenna, but get out of here." </p><p> "You don't have to tell me twice." </p><p> "I already did," Slick said with an amused chuckle.<br> </p><p> It was still early in the afternoon as Jenna walked down the corridor to the bank of elevators. <i>Gotta see Danny before I leave,</i> she thought, feeling a lingering trace of sadness as she rode silently up to rehab. </p><p> Jenna shook herself and forced a smile onto her face as the elevator slowed to a stop. Danny was going to be all right. A few scars on his throat and abdomen, but all in all, things could have been much, much worse. </p><p> Most of the staff in the rehab wing knew her because of all the hours she'd spent up there with Danny over the past week. As she walked down the hall to Danny's room, she smiled greetings to the nurses and orderlies, even the two or three she didn't recognize. She rapped lightly on the door, then turned the handle and opened it slowly. </p><p> Danny lay in the hospital bed in the darkened room, and at first Jenna wasn't sure if he was awake or asleep. </p><p> "Jenna," he said, his voice low and raspy. Tired but happy. </p><p> "Hey," she said. "Did I wake you?" </p><p> "No, no, I'm just lying here being bored." He waved her in. </p><p> "How you doing?" Jenna went to the bedside and gently placed her hand on top of his. "I mean, other than bored?" </p><p> "Doing a lot better," he told her. </p><p> Danny's throat was still thickly bandaged, and it probably made smiling uncomfortable. But that didn't stop him. His eyes sparkled, and there was no denying that he looked better than he had even the day before. A skin graft had been necessary to repair the third-degree burn on his abdomen, but he was recovering quickly. She was amazed by how resilient he was, but then again, there were a lot of things about Danny that amazed her. </p><p> "I always feel better when you come to visit," Danny said, his smile widening. "You're my best therapy, Jenna." </p><p> With a start, she realized that she was still touching his hand and pulled hers back. Jenna shook her head slightly. Sometimes it wasn't easy to be just his friend. Though she had already determined not to let her feelings for him get in the way, it was a lot simpler to decide that than to implement it. Maybe her heart could move on to other things, but the echo of what she felt would probably linger for a while. </p><p> "I just wanted to stop by and see you before I left," Jenna said. </p><p> "Oh, that's right. You're flying out tomorrow morning. My island girl." </p><p> Jenna shivered a little at those words. </p><p> <i>My island girl. </i></p><p><i> Way to give mixed signals, Detective,</i> she thought, wondering exactly how possessive the <i>my</i> was meant to be. Much as she was glad her presence had helped him during his hospitalization, part of her was happy she was going to be away for a while. </p><p> "That's me," Jenna said with a wide grin. "Just me and Yoshiko and fun in the sun." </p><p> "Prey for all the island guys," Danny said archly. </p><p> "We can take care of ourselves." </p><p> "That's for sure," Danny said. "And hey, if anybody deserves a vacation, it's you. So when will you be back?" </p><p> "We've got a flight back next Sunday afternoon," Jenna replied. "We'll be back in Logan sometime around eight o'clock." </p><p> "Well, I hope you really do relax. No classes. No work. Have a great time," Danny said. "It's about time you got a chance to be a teenager for a while." </p><p> <i>Teenager,</i> Jenna thought, taken a bit off guard. She stared at him a moment, unsure how to respond. <i>That's how he thinks of me. I'm just a teenager to him.</i> </p><p> Part of her bristled...</p></p><h2>God&#39;s Masterwork: A Concerto in Sixty-Six Movements (Volume 3: Hosea Through Malachi)</h2><p>In the Minor Prophets of the Bible, stern-minded men proclaimed God&#39;s displeasure over sin, announced His Judgement, offered His mercy and forgiveness, and reminded people that God would keep His covenants with them.

She says it's an emergency."<br><br>Sean rolled his shoulders to ease the tension, his mind still in the operating room.<br><br>His patient was a promising soccer player. He'd torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, a common enough injury that had ended plenty of sports careers. Sean was determined it wasn't going to end this one. The procedure had gone well, although surgery was only the beginning. What followed would be a lengthy rehabilitation that would require dedication and determination from all involved.<br><br>Still thinking about how to manage expectations, he took the phone from the nurse. "Sean O'Neil."<br><br>"Sean? Where the hell were you last night?"<br><br>Braced for a different conversation, Sean frowned with irritation. "Veronica? You shouldn't be calling me here. I was told this was an emergency."<br><br>"It <em>is</em> an emergency!" Her voice rose along with her temper. "Next time you invite me to dinner, have the decency to show up."<br><br><em>Damn.</em><br><br>A nurse came out of the operating room and handed him a form.<br><br>"Veronica, I'm sorry." He tucked the phone between his cheek and his shoulder and gestured for a pen. "I was called back to the hospital. A colleague had problems with a patient. I was operating."<br><br>"And you couldn't have called me? I waited in that restaurant for an hour. An hour, Sean! A man tried to pick me up."<br><br>Sean signed the form. "Was he nice?"<br><br>"Do <em>not joke about it.</em> It was the most embarrassing hour of my life. Don't ever, <em>ever</em> do that to me again."<br><br>He handed the form back to the nurse with a brief smile. "You'd rather I left a patient to bleed to death?"<br><br>"I'd rather you honored your commitments."<br><br>"I'm a surgeon. My first commitment is to my patients."<br><br>"So what you're saying is that if you had to choose between me and work, you'd pick work?"<br><br>"Yes." The fact that she'd asked that question showed how little she knew him. "That is what I'm saying."<br><br>"Damn you, Sean. I hate you." But there was a wobble in her voice. "Tell me honestly, is it just me or is it all women?"<br><br>"It's me. I'm bad at relationships, you know that. Right now my focus is my career."<br><br>"One of these days you're going to wake up alone in that fancy apartment of yours and regret all the time you spent working."<br><br>He decided not to point out that he woke up alone through choice. He never invited women back to his apartment. He was barely ever there himself. "My work is important to me. You knew that when you met me."<br><br>"No, important is being dedicated to what you do but still having a personal life. What work is to you, Sean O'Neil, is an obsession. You are single-minded and focused to the exclusion of everything else. That might make you a brilliant doctor but it makes you a lousy date. And here's a news flash&#x2014;being charming and good in bed doesn't stop you being a selfish, workaholic bastard."<br><br>"Sean?" Another nurse appeared at his elbow, her pink cheeks and awkward demeanor suggesting she'd overheard that last sentence. "The team coach is waiting outside for news along with the boy's parents. Will you talk to them?"<br><br>"Are you even listening to me?" Veronica's voice came down the phone, shrill and irritated. "Are you having another conversation while you're talking to me?"<br><br><em>Hell.</em><br><br>Sean closed his eyes. "I've just come out of the operating room." He rubbed his fingers over his forehead. "I need to speak to the relatives."<br><br>"They can wait five minutes!"<br><br>"They're worried. If that was your kid in recovery, you'd want to know what was going on. I have to go. Goodbye, Veronica. I really <em>am</em> sorry about last night."<br><br>"No, wait! Don't go!" Her voice was urgent. "I love you, Sean. I really love you. Despite everything, I think we have something special. We can make this work. You just need to flex a little bit more."<br><br>Sweat pricked at the back of his neck. He saw the nurse's eyes widen.<br><br><em>How had he got himself in this situation?</em><br><br>For the first time in years he'd made a misjudgment. He'd thought Veronica was the sort of woman who was happy to live in the moment. Turned out he was wrong about that.<br><br>"I have to go, Veronica."<br><br>"All right, <em>I'll</em> flex. I'm sorry, I'm being a shrew. Let me cook you dinner tonight, I promise I won't complain if you're late. You can show up whenever. I'll&#x2014;"<br><br>"Veronica&#x2014;" he cut across her "&#x2014;do <em>not</em> apologize to me when I'm the one who should be apologizing to you. You need to find a guy who will give you the attention you deserve."<br><br>There was a tense silence. "Are you saying it's over?"<br><br>As far as Sean was concerned it had never started. "Yeah, that's what I'm saying. There are hundreds of guys out there only too willing to flex. Go and find one of them." He hung up, aware that the nurse was still watching him.<br><br>He was so tired he couldn't even remember her name.<br><br>Ann? No, that wasn't right.<br><br>Angela. Yes, it was Angela.<br><br>Fatigue descended like a gray fog, slowing his thinking. He needed sleep.<br><br>He'd been called to an emergency in the night and had been on his feet operating since dawn. Soon the adrenaline would fade and when it did he knew he was going to crash big-time. Sean wanted to be somewhere near his bed when that happened. He had the use of a room at the hospital but he preferred to make it back to his waterside apartment where he could nurse a beer and watch life on the water.<br><br>"Dr. O'Neil? Sean? I'm so sorry. I wouldn't have put the call through if I'd known it was personal. She said she was a doctor." The look in her eyes told him she'd have no objection to being Veronica's replacement. Sean didn't think she'd be flattered to know he'd temporarily forgotten her existence.<br><br>"Not your fault. I'll talk to the relatives&#x2014;" He was tempted to take a shower first, but then he remembered the white face of the boy's mother when she'd arrived at the hospital and decided the shower could wait. "I'll go and see them now."<br><br>"You've had a really long day. If you want to come by my place after work, I make a mac and cheese that is wicked good."<br><br>She was sweet, caring and pretty. Angela would come close to most men's idea of a perfect woman.<br><br>Not his.<br><br>His idea of a perfect woman was one who didn't want anything from him.<br><br>Relationships meant sacrifice and compromise. He wasn't prepared to do either of those things, which was why he had remained resolutely single.<br><br>"As you just witnessed, I am an appalling date." He managed what he hoped was a disarming smile. "I'd either be working and not show up at all, or so tired I'd fall asleep on your sofa. You can definitely do better."<br><br>"I think you're amazing, Dr. O'Neil. I work with loads of doctors, and you're easily the best. If I ever needed a surgeon, I'd want you to look after me. And I wouldn't care if you fell asleep on my sofa."<br><br>"Yes, you would." Eventually they always did. "I'll go and talk to the family now."<br><br>"That's kind of you. His mother is worried."<br><br>He saw the worry the moment he laid eyes on the woman.<br><br>She sat without moving, her hands gripping her skirt as she tried to contain anxiety made worse by waiting. Her husband was on his feet, hands thrust in his pockets, shoulders hunched as he talked to the coach. Sean knew the coach vaguely. He'd found him to be ruthless and relentlessly pushy and it seemed that surgery on his star player hadn't softened his approach.<br><br>The guy wanted miracles and he wanted them yesterday. Sean knew this particular coach's priority wasn't the long-term welfare of the kid lying in the OR, but the future of his team. As a sports injury specialist he dealt with players and coaches all the time. Some were great. Others made him wish he'd chosen law instead of medicine.<br><br>The moment the boy's father saw Sean he sprang forward like a Rottweiler pouncing on an intruder.<br><br>"Well?"<br><br>The coach was drinking water from a plastic cup.<br><br>"You fixed it?"<br><br>He made it sound like a hole in a roof, Sean thought. Slap a new shingle on and it will be as good as new. Change the tire and get the car back on the road.<br><br>"Surgery is only the beginning. It's going to be a long process."<br><br>"Maybe you should have got him into surgery sooner instead of waiting."<br><br><em>Maybe you should stop practicing armchair medicine.</em><br><br>Noticing the boy's mother digging her nails into her legs, Sean decided not to lock horns. "All the research shows that the outcome is better when surgery is carried out on a pain-free mobile joint." He'd told them the same thing a week before but neither the coach nor the father had wanted to listen then and they didn't want to listen now.<br><br>"How soon can he play again?"<br><br>Sean wondered what it must be like for the boy, growing up with these two on his back.<br><br>"It's too early to set a timetable for return. If you push too hard, he won't be playing at all. The focus now is on rehab. He has to take that seriously. So do you." This time his tone was as blunt as his words. He'd seen promising careers ruined by coaches who pushed too hard too soon, and by players without the patience to understand that the body didn't heal according to a sporting schedule.<br><br>"It's a competitive world, Dr. O'Neil. Staying at the top takes determination."<br><br>Sean wondered if the coach was talking about his player or himself. "It also takes a healthy body."<br><br>The boy's mother, silent until now, stood up. "Is he all right?" The question earned her a scowl from her husband.<br><br>"Hell, woman, I just asked him that! Try listening."<br><br>"You didn't ask." Her voice shook. "You asked if he'd play again. That's all you care about. He's a person, Jim, not a machine. He's our son."<br><br>"At his age I was&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know what you were doing at his age and I tell you if you carry on like this you will destroy your relationship with him. He will hate you forever."<br><br>"He should be thanking me for pushing him. He has talent. Ambition. It needs to be nurtured."<br><br>"It's your ambition, Jim. This was <em>your</em> ambition and now you're trying to live all your dreams through your son. And what you're doing isn't nurturing. You put pressure on him and then layer more and more on until the boy is crushed under the weight of it." The words burst out of her and she paused for a moment as if she'd shocked herself. "I apologize, Dr. O'Neil."<br><br>"No need to apologize. I understand your concern."<br><br>Tension snapped his muscles tight. No one understood the pressures of family expectation better than he did. He'd been raised with it.<br><br><em>Do you know how it feels to be crushed by the weight of someone else's dreams? Do you know how that feels, Sean?</em><br><br>The voice in his head was so real he rocked on his feet and had to stop himself glancing over his shoulder to check his father wasn't standing there. He'd been dead two years, but sometimes it felt like yesterday.<br><br>He thrust the sudden wash of grief aside, uncomfortable with the sudden intrusion of the personal into his professional life.<br><br>He was more in need of sleep than he'd thought.<br><br>"Scott's doing fine, Mrs. Turner. Everything went smoothly. You'll be able to see him soon."<br><br>The tension left the woman's body. "Thank you, Doctor. I&#x2014; You've been so good to him right from the start. And to me. When he starts playing&#x2014;" she shot her husband a look "&#x2014;how do we know the same thing won't happen again? He wasn't even near another player. He just crumpled."<br><br>"Eighty percent of ACL tears are non-contact." Sean ignored both the woman's husband and the coach and focused on her. He felt sorry for her, the referee in a game of ambition. "The anterior cruciate ligament connects your thigh to your shin. It doesn't do a whole lot if you're just going about your normal day, but it's an essential part of controlling the rotation forces developed during twisting actions."<br><br>She gave him a blank look. "Twisting actions?"<br><br>"Jumping, pivoting and abrupt changes of direction. It's an injury common among soccer players, basketball players and skiers."<br><br>"Your brother Tyler had the same, didn't he?" The coach butted in. "And it was all over for him. It killed his career as a ski racer. Hell of a blow for such a gifted athlete."<br><br>His brother's injury had been far more complicated than that, but Sean never talked about his famous brother. "Our aim with surgery is to return the knee joint to near-normal stability and function but it's a team effort and rehabilitation is a big part of that effort. Scott is young, fit and motivated. I'm confident he'll make a full recovery and be as strong as he was before the injury, providing you encourage him to attack rehab with the same degree of dedication he shows to the game." He hardened his tone because he needed them to pay attention. "Push too hard or too soon and that won't be the case."<br><br>The coach nodded. "So can we start rehabilitation right away?"<br><br><em>Sure, just throw him a ball while he's still unconscious.</em><br><br>"We generally find it helps for a patient to have come around from the anesthetic."<br><br>The man's cheeks turned dusky-red. "You think I'm pushy, but this kid just wants to play and it's my job to make sure he gets whatever he needs. Which is why we're here," he said gruffly. "People say you're the best.<br><br>Everyone I talked to gave me the same response. If it's a knee injury, you want Sean O'Neil. ACL reconstruction and sports injuries are your specialty. Didn't realize you were Tyler O'Neil's brother until a few weeks ago. How's he coping now he can't compete? That must be hard."<br><br>"He's doing just fine." The response was automatic. At the height of Tyler's skiing success the whole family had been bombarded by the media and they'd learned to deflect the intrusive questions, some about Tyler's breathtaking talent, others about his colorful personal life.<br><br>"I read somewhere he can only ski for recreation now." The coach pulled a face. "Must be hard for a guy like Tyler. I met him once."<br><br>Making a note to commiserate with his brother, Sean steered the conversation back on topic. "Let's focus on Scott." He went through it again, repeating words he'd already spoken.<br><br>Drumming the message home took another twenty minutes. By the time he'd showered, checked on a few of his patients and climbed into his car, two hours had passed.<br><br>Sean sat for a moment, summoning the energy to drive the distance to his waterfront home.<br><br>The weekend lay ahead, a stretch of time filled with infinite possibilities.<br><br>For the next forty-eight hours his time was his own and he was ready to savor every moment. But first he was going to sleep.<br><br>The phone he kept for his personal use rang and he cursed for a moment, assuming it was Veronica, and then frowned when the screen told him it was his twin brother, Jackson. Along with the name came the guilt. It festered inside him, buried deep but always there.<br><br>He wondered why his brother would be calling him late on a Friday.<br><br>A crisis at home?<br><br>Snow Crystal Resort had been in their family for four generations. It hadn't occurred to any of them that it might not be in the family for another four. The sudden death of his father had revealed the truth. The business had been in trouble for years. The discovery that their home was under threat had sent a ripple of shock through the whole family.<br><br>It was Jackson who had left a thriving business in Europe to return home to Vermont and save Snow Crystal from a disaster none of the three brothers had even known existed.<br></p><h2>Trouble with Tribbles: The Birth Sale and Final Production of One Episode (Star Trek)</h2><p>The story of a television script, where it came from, how it was written, how it was eventually filmed and finally got onto the air.</p><p></p><h2>Cop Shot</h2><p>Describes the murder of rookie NYPD officer Edward Byrne by crack dealers while he guarded the home of a witness, the manhunt that followed, and the devastating impact of drugs on urban America</p><p>New York City police officer Byrne, age 22, was slain in 1988 while guarding the home of a witness in a drug case in Queens. There were no lack of informants to the murder; the killers themselves, four young crack dealers ordered to carry out the execution by a minor druglord, boasted about their deed. They were captured, tried and found guilty; all received long prison terms. In McAlary's view, these men--products of broken homes, raised on the streets, caught up in the violent crack culture of their neighborhood--were ignorant and stupid. But then, few gods occupy the hard-bitten New York Daily News columnist's personal pantheon. He slams the intentions and abilities of former mayor Edward Koch and ex-police commissioner Benjamin Ward; he also depicts the murdered officer's father, once on the force himself, as a publicity-hungry headline grabber, and--with some notable exceptions--presents the police assigned to the case as a virtual lynch mob. Journalistic writing of a high order, the book tells a grim story with streetwise cynicism and telegraphic urgency. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Draw and Sell....Comic Strips....

With detailed instructions, beautiful photography, and health and safety advice, it explains how such equipment as soldering irons, heat guns, and even household irons can add stunning levels of texture and variety to all types of fabrics. The range of techniques covered is amazing: hot and cold foiling, painted and plain Bondaweb (fusible webbing), bead making from synthetics, three-dimensional work, embossing powders, and so much more. There are even ideas for melting and distorting plastic bags and cellophane, and for using a combination of tools and fabrics to create various layers on a single piece.</p><p>Kim Thittichai is a popular textile artist who specialises in teaching experimental textiles. Her speciality is creating three-dimensional textile forms. She does workshops and lecture nationally and exhibits her work at various textiles shows across the UK. She is the author of the best selling Hot Textiles. She lives in Brighton.Hot , in British artist Thittichai&#x2019;s parlance, means the application of heat to specific textiles to create a range of works, from decorative hangings to practical gift cards. As the green movement increases in power, hot can also denote a trend that&#x2019;s hard to ignore: how to recycle and repurpose the amazing quantity of grocery packaging (among others) that the world produces? Thankfully, the author uses both Rs in this meandering exploration of transforming space-age materials and, yes, plastics. Textiles take first and second place, whether name brands like Tyvek (10 percent polyester) and different weights of the interfacing Pellon to plan everyday plastic shopping bags and candy wrappers. Much space, too, is devoted to safety, such as toiling in a well-ventilated room and wearing protection while using irons, solderers, and guns. Yet, since techniques are so heavily dependent on the combination of materials and amount of heat, readers will have to be content with the glorious number of color examples from nine artists, a handful of exercises to practice, and a few projects (brooch, greeting cards). True eco-imagination at work&#x2014;and play. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Under the Knife</h2><p>The Mira books feature a range of novels by well-known and sometimes new authors. The common thread running through the series is the focus on love, romance and man-woman relationships.</p><p>Sunday Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen is one of the biggest names in crime fiction. A former doctor, Tess has now retired from medicine to write full-time. She and her family live in Maine.Melodrama and logical flaws slay this tale of murder and yuppie love. Gerritsen ( A Call After Midnight ) gets off to a flying start with a death during routine surgery. Although medical records suggest the patient died due to an error by anesthesiologist Kate Chesne,sp ok/pk who is sued for malpractice, she persuades David Ransom, lawyer for the victim's parents, that the records are suspect. Together they discover that the "accident" is one of a series of murders. Fortunately for the protagonists, the killer, who has efficiently cut the throats of two other victims and fractured the skull of a third, decides for no convincing reason to indulge in an elaborate frame-up that could easily fail. Characters are also inconsistent: in the beginning David plans to "expose" and "destroy" Kate, but tells her a few pages later that he doesn't attack doctors, only their mistakes. The lovers' squabbling and passion never rise above romance formula; even the author characterizes one of her scenes as "a tableau taken straight out of some soap opera." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Octopussy: And, the Living Daylights</h2><p>For James Bond, British secret agent 007, international espionage can be a dirty business. Whether it is tracking down a wayward major who has taken a deadly secret with him to the Caribbean; identifying a top Russian agent secretly bidding for a Faberge egg in a Sotheby&#39;s auction room; or ruthlessly gunning down an unlikely assassin in sniper&#39;s alley between East and West Berlin, Bond always closes the case - with extreme prejudice.</p><p>Born in London in 1908, Ian Fleming worked as a banker and journalist before serving in the British Naval Intelligence during World War II. He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.'You know what?' said Major Dexter Smythe to the octopus. 'You're going to have a real treat today if I can manage it.' <p>He had spoken aloud and his breath had steamed up the glass of his Pirelli mask. He put his feet down to the sand and stood up. The water reached to his armpits. He took off the mask and spat into it, rubbed the spit round the glass, rinsed it clean and pulled the rubber band of the mask back over his head. He bent down again.</p> <p>The eye in the mottled brown sack was still watching him carefully from the hole in the coral, but now the tip of a single small tentacle wavered hesitatingly an inch or two out of the shadows and quested vaguely with its pink suckers uppermost. Dexter Smythe smiled with satisfaction. Given time, perhaps one more month on top of the two during which he had been chumming up with the octopus, and he would have tamed the darling. But he wasn't going to have that month. Should he take a chance today and reach down and offer his hand, instead of the expected lump of raw meat on the end of his spear, to the tentacle - shake it by the hand, so to speak? No, Pussy, he thought. I can't quite trust you yet. Almost certainly other tentacles would whip out of the hole and up his arm. He only needed to be dragged down less than two feet, the cork valve on his mask would automatically close and he would be suffocated inside it or, if he tore it off, drowned. He might get in a quick lucky jab with his spear, but it would take more than that to kill Pussy. No. Perhaps later in the day. It would be rather like playing Russian roulette, and at about the same five-to-one-odds. It might be a quick, a whimsical way out of his troubles! But not now. It would leave the interesting question unsolved. And he had promised that nice Professor Bengry at the Institute. Dexter Smythe swam leisurely off towards the reef, his eyes questing for one shape only, the squat sinister wedge of a scorpion fish, or, as Bengry would put it, Scorpaena Plumieri.</p> <p>Major Dexter Smythe, OBE, Royal Marines (Retd), was the remains of a once brave and resourceful officer and of a handsome man who had made easy sexual conquests all his military life and particularly among the Wrens and Wracs and ATS who manned the com-munications and secretariat of the very special task force to which he had been attached at the end of his service career. Now he was fifty-four, slightly bald and his belly sagged in the Jantzen trunks. And he had had two coronary thromboses. His doctor, Jimmy Greaves (who had been one of their high poker game at Queen's Club when Dexter Smythe had first come to Jamaica), had half-jocularly described the later one, only a month before, as 'the second warning'. But, in his well-chosen clothes, his varicose veins out of sight and his stomach flattened by a discreet support belt behind an immaculate cummerbund, he was still a fine figure of a man at a cocktail party or dinner on the North Shore, and it was a mystery to his friends and neighbours why, in defiance of the two ounces of whisky and ten cigarettes a day to which his doctor had rationed him, he persisted in smoking like a chimney and going to bed drunk, if amiably drunk, every night.</p> <p>The truth of the matter was that Dexter Smythe had arrived at the frontier of the death-wish. The origins of this state of mind were many and not all that complex. He was irretrievably tied to Jamaica, and tropical sloth had gradually riddled him so that while outwardly he appeared a piece of fairly solid hardwood, under the varnished surface the termites of sloth, self-indulgence, guilt over an ancient sin and general disgust with himself had eroded his once hard core into dust. Since the death of Mary two years before, he had loved no one. He wasn't even sure that he had really loved her, but he knew that, every hour of the day, he missed her love of him and her gay, untidy, chiding and often irritating presence, and though he ate their canapes and drank their martinis, he had nothing but contempt for the international riff-raff with whom he consorted on the North Shore. He could perhaps have made friends with the soldier elements, the gentleman-farmers inland, or the plantation owners on the coast, the professional men and the politicians, but that would mean regaining some serious purpose in life which his sloth, his spiritual accidie, prevented, and cutting down on the bottle, which he was definitely unwilling to do. So Major Smythe was bored, bored to death, and, but for one factor in his life, he would long ago have swallowed the bottle of barbiturates he had easily acquired from a local doctor. The lifeline that kept him clinging to the edge of the cliff was a tenuous one. Heavy drinkers veer towards an exaggeration of their basic temperaments, the classic four - Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic. The Sanguine drunk goes gay to the point of hysteria and idiocy. The Phlegmatic sinks into a morass of sullen gloom. The Choleric is the fighting drunk of the cartoonists who spends much of his life in prison for smashing people and things, and the Melancholic succumbs to self-pity, mawkishness and tears. Major Smythe was a Melancholic who had slid into a drooling fantasy woven around the birds and insects and fish that inhabited the five acres of Wavelets (the name he had given his small villa is symptomatic), its beach and the coral reef beyond. The fish were his particular favourites. He referred to them as 'people' and, since reef fish stick to their territories as closely as do most small birds, after two years he knew them all intimately, 'loved' them and believed that they loved him in return.</p> <p>They certainly knew him, as the denizens of zoos know their keepers, because he was a daily and a regular provider, scraping off algae and stirring up the sand and rocks for the bottom-feeders, breaking up sea eggs and urchins for the small carnivores and bringing out scraps of offal for the larger ones, and now, as he swam slowly and heavily up and down the reef and through the channels that led out to deep water, his 'people' swarmed around him fearlessly and expectantly, darting at the tip of the three-pronged spear they knew only as a prodigal spoon, flirting right up to the glass of the Pirelli and even, in the case of the fearless, pugnacious demoiselles, nipping softly at his feet and legs. Part of Major Smythe's mind took in all these brilliantly coloured little 'people', but today he had a job to do and while he greeted them in unspoken words - 'Morning, Beau Gregory' to the dark-blue demoiselle sprinkled with bright-blue spots, the 'jewel fish' that exactly resembles the starlit fashioning of a bottle of Worth's 'Vol de Nuit'; 'Sorry. Not today, sweetheart,' to a fluttering butterfly fish with false black 'eyes' on its tail and, 'You're too fat anyway, Blue Boy,' to an indigo parrot fish that must have weighed a good ten pounds - his eyes were searching for only one of his 'people' - his only enemy on the reef, the only one he killed on sight, a scorpion fish.</p> <p>Scorpion fish inhabit most of the southern waters of the world, and the 'rascasse' that is the foundation of bouillabaisse belongs to the family. The West Indian variety runs up to only about twelve inches long and perhaps a pound in weight. It is by far the ugliest fish in the sea, as if nature were giving warning. It is a mottled brownish grey with a heavy, wedge-shaped shaggy head. It has fleshy pendulous 'eyebrows' that droop over angry red eyes and a coloration and broken silhouette that are perfect camouflage on the reef. Though a small fish, its heavily toothed mouth is so wide that it can swallow whole most of the smaller reef fishes, but its supreme weapon lies in its erectile dorsal fins, the first few of which, acting on contact like hypodermic needles, are fed by poison glands containing enough tetrodotoxin to kill a man if they merely graze him in a vulnerable spot - in an artery, for instance, or over the heart or in the groin. They constitute the only real danger to the reef swimmer, far more dangerous than barracuda or shark, because, supremely confident in their camouflage and armoury, they flee before nothing except the very close approach of a foot or actual contact. Then they flit only a few yards on wide and bizarrely striped pectorals and settle again watchfully either on the sand, where they look like a lump of overgrown coral, or amongst the rocks and seaweed, where they virtually disappear. And Major Smythe was determined to find one, spear it and give it to his octopus to see if it would take or spurn it, see if one of the ocean's great predators would recognize the deadliness of another, know of its poison. Would the octopus consume the belly and leave the spines? Would it eat the lot and, if so, would it suffer from the poison? These were the questions Bengry at the Institute wanted answered and today, since it was going to be the beginning of the end of Major Smythe's life at Wavelets and though it might mean the end of his darling Octopussy, Major Smythe had decided to find out the answers and leave one tiny memorial to his now futile life in some dusty corner of the Institute's marine biological files.</p> <p>For, only a couple of hours earlier, Major Dexter Smythe's already dismal life had changed very much for the worse. So much for the worse that he would be lucky if, in a few weeks' time - time for the sending of cables from Government House to the Colonial Office, to be relayed to the Secret Service and thence to Scotland Yard and the Public Prosecutor, and for Major Smythe's transportation to London with a police escort - he got away with a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p> <p>And all this because of a man called Bond, Commander James Bond, who had turned up at ten thirty that morning in a taxi from Kingston.</p> <p>The day had started normally. Major Smythe had awoken from his Seconal sleep, swallowed a couple of Panadols (his heart condition forbade him aspirin), showered and skimped his breakfast under the umbrella-shaped sea-almonds and spent an hour feeding the remains of his breakfast to the birds. He then took his prescribed doses of anti-coagulant and blood-pressure pills and killed time with the Daily Gleaner until he could have his elevenses which, for months now, he had advanced to ten thirty. He had just poured himself the first of two stiff brandies and ginger ales, 'the drunkard's drink', when he heard the car coming up the drive.</p> <p>Luna, his coloured housekeeper, came out into the garden and announced, 'Gemmun to see you, Major.'</p> <p>'What's his name?'</p> <p>'Him doan say. Major. Him say to tell you him come from Govment House.'</p> <p>Major Smythe was wearing nothing but a pair of old khaki shorts and sandals. He said, 'All right, Luna. Put him in the living room and say I won't be a moment,' and went round the back way into his bedroom and put on a white bush shirt and trousers and brushed his hair. Government House! Now what the hell?</p> <p>As soon as he had walked through into the living-room and seen the tall man in the dark-blue tropical suit standing at the picture window looking out to sea, Major Smythe had somehow sensed bad news. Then, when the man had turned slowly to look at him with watchful, serious blue-grey eyes, he had known that this was officialdom, and when his cheery smile was not returned, inimical officialdom. A chill had run down Major Smythe's spine. 'They' had somehow found out.</p> <p>'Well, well. I'm Smythe. I gather you're from Government House. How's Sir Kenneth?'</p> <p>There was somehow no question of shaking hands. The man said, 'I haven't met him. I only arrived a couple of days ago. I've been out round the island most of the time. My name's Bond, James Bond. I'm from the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>Major Smythe remembered the hoary euphemism for the Secret Service. He said, with forced cheerfulness, 'Oh. The old firm?'</p> <p>The question had been ignored. 'Is there somewhere we can talk?'</p> <p>'Rather. Anywhere you like. Here or in the garden? What about a drink?' Major Smythe clinked the ice in the glass he still held in his hand.' Rum and ginger's the local poison. I prefer the ginger by itself. 'The lie came out with the automatic smoothness of the alcoholic.</p> <p>' No thanks. And here would be fine.' The man leaned 5negligently against the wide mahogany windowsill.</p> <p>Major Smythe sat down and threw a jaunty leg over the low arm of one of the comfortable planters' chairs he had had copied from an original by the local cabinet-maker. He pulled out the drink coaster from the other 1arm, took a deep pull at his glass and slid it, with a consciously steady hand, down into the hole in the wood. 'Well,' he said cheerily, looking the other man straight in the eyes,'what can I do for you? Somebody been up to some dirty work on the North Shore and you need a spare hand? Be glad to get into harness again. It's been a long time since those days, but I can still remember some of the old routines.'</p> <p>'Do you mind if I smoke?' The man had already got his cigarette case in his hand. It was a flat gun-metal one that would hold a round fifty. Somehow this small sign of a shared weakness comforted Major Smythe.</p> <p>'Of course, my dear fellow.' He made a move to get up, his lighter ready. 'It's all right, thanks.' James Bond had already lit his cigarette. 'No, it's nothing local. I want to, I've been sent out to ask you to recall your work for the Service at the end of the war.' James Bond paused and looked down at Major Smythe carefully. 'Particularly the time when you were working with the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau.'</p> <p>Major Smythe laughed sharply. He had known it. He had known it for absolutely sure. But when it came out of this man's mouth, the laugh had been forced out of Major Smythe like the scream of a hit man. 'Oh Lord, yes. Good old MOB. That was a lark all right.' He laughed again. He felt the anginal pain, brought on by the pressure of what he knew was coming, build up across his chest. He dipped his hand into his trouser pocket, tilted the little bottle into the palm of his hand and slipped the white TNT pill under his tongue. He was amused to see the tension coil up in the other man, the way the eyes narrowed watchfully. It's all right, my dear fellow. This isn't a death pill. He said, 'You troubled with acidosis? No? It slays me when I go on a bender. Last night. Party at Jamaica Inn. One really ought to stop thinking one's always twenty-five. Anyway, let's get back to MOB Force. Not many of us left, I suppose.' He felt the pain across his chest withdraw into its lair. 'Something to do with the Official History?'</p> <p>James Bond looked down at the tip of his cigarette. 'Not exactly.'</p> <p>'I expect you know I wrote most of the chapter on the Force for the War Book. It's a long time ago now. Doubt if I'd have much to add today.'</p> <p>'Nothing more about that operation in the Tyrol - place called Ober Aurach, about a mile east of Kitzbuhel?'</p> <p>One of the names he had been living with for all these years forced another harsh laugh out of Major Smythe. 'That was a piece of cake! You've never seen such a shambles. All those Gestapo toughs with their doxies. All of 'em hog-drunk. They'd kept their files all tickety-boo. Handed them over without a murmur. Hoped that'd earn 'em easy treatment, I suppose. We gave the stuff a first going-over and shipped all the bods off to the Munich camp. Last I heard of them. Most of them hanged for war crimes, I expect. We handed the bumph over to HO. at Salzburg. Then we went on up the Mittersill valley after another hideout.' Major Smythe took a good pull at his drink and lit a cigarette. He looked up. 'That's the long and the short of it.'</p> <p>'You were Number 2 at the time, I think.

Five years have passed since Edith Campbell Berry&#39;s triumphant arrival at the League of Nations in Geneva, determined to right the wrongs of the world.

Edith&#39;s life too, has changed: her marriage and her work are no longer the anchors in her life she is restless, unsure, feeling the weight of history upon her and her world. As her certainties crumble, Edith is once again joined by Ambrose Westwood, her old friend and lover. Their reunion is joyful, and her old anxiety about their unconventional relationship is replaced by a feeling that all things are possible at least in her private life.

A sardonic portrayal of one white, middle-class, Midwestern girl's coming-of-age, the novel takes a wry and prescient look at a range of experiences treated at the time as taboo but which were ultimately accepted as matters of major political significance: sexual harassment, job discrimination, the sexual double standard, rape, abortion restrictions, the double binds of marriage and motherhood, and the frantic quest for beauty. </p><p>The book went on to sell more than a million copies and is regarded today as a classic, one of the first and best pieces of fiction born of the women's liberation movement.

Now it's back, in an anniversary edition reprint. The narrator, Sasha Davis, an Ohio girl, high school prom queen, now divorced and in a second marriage "headed for the same miserable demise as the first," is still searching for herself. Touching on issues that continue to color the cultural landscape -- abortion, date rape, balancing work and motherhood -- Memoirs was, for some readers, what the Saturday Review (May 20, 1972) called a "break-through book," the "first important novel to emerge from the Women's Liberation movement." </p><p>The Post's reviewer, Barbara Howar (April 26, 1972), took the messages of the book personally: "With uncomfortable frequency, I find myself torn between the warring factions of the Women's Rights Movement and its natural enemy, the Great White Male. So grand is my passion for both that I resent having to take sides which it becomes my sticky business to do in commenting on this first novel. . . . Heroine Sasha recounts with heavy humor her blundering quest for autonomy in a male-oriented society . . . terrorized by bullying, domineering little boys who grew into big ones.</p><p>"Having been a Prom Queen a time or two, I can readily share Sasha's rage at being pushed into beauty-worship before she gets the message that a woman just might need something more in life than the identity of the man she marries. . . . </p><p>"Sasha refuses to see that her parents as well as the goodly number of men in her life are victimized by the same system that did her in, that we are all in the soup together. . . . </p><p>"After this cathartic memoir, my guess is that Alix Shulman will get her sense of humor and fair-play into some less paranoid perspective and write a constructive book better suited to her talent and to the vast army of troubled women who need her." </p><p>Shulman has written three other novels, several children's books, two books on Emma Goldman and two memoirs, A Good Enough Daughter and Drinking the Rain. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Those who don't make visible progress toward that goal within the first year or two will likely find themselves looking for another job. It is precisely because of this growing breakthrough imperative that managers today, whether in corporations or nonprofits, need to get off to a fast start. They don't have time for mistakes or for going back and redoing what they should have done right in the first place. </p><p>But, despite the intensity of these pressures, despite the high expectations and short time frames, a number of CEOs and general managers turn in truly exceptional results. How do they meet and exceed the breakthrough imperative? To answer this question, consultants and former managers Mark Gottfredson and Steve Schaubert interviewed more than forty CEOs from both industry and the nonprofit sector, conducted an intensive study of what successful managers do right&#x2014;and what some do wrong&#x2014;and drew on their own combined fifty-plus years of experience at Bain &amp; Company, where their insights have consistently been found in the pages of the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>. Together they came up with the four straightforward principles&#x2014;deceptively simple yet remarkably powerful&#x2014;that everyone must follow to succeed at achieving breakthrough results: </p><blockquote>1. Costs and prices always decline<br>2. Competitive position determines options<br>3. Customers and profit pools don't stand still<br>4. Simplicity gets results</blockquote><p>Although seemingly simplistic, mastering these four laws means mastering the basics of great management&#x2014;a foundation on which to build the rest of one's management strategy.

The exception is Gottfredson and Schaubert relying on both Frederick Reichheld&#x2019;s The Loyalty Effect (1996) and&nbsp;Chris Zook&#x2019;s Profit from the Core (2004) to explain and show new leaders the how-to&#x2019;s of achieving breakthrough results. The four rules behind the authors&#x2019; program seem deceptively simple: (1) costs and prices always decline, (2) competitive position&nbsp;determines your options, (3) customers and profit pools don&#x2019;t stand still, and (4) simplicity gets results. Yet, as to be expected, charts, graphs,&nbsp;and some rather complicated calculations, along with a wealth of corporate data (some 1,500 companies), dominate the more detailed explanations. Corporate case histories do provide enough illustrative material to negate any mathematical mysteries. After expounding on these basics and including implications for general managers at the end of each chapter, the authors outline a road map for new leaders to follow: how to diagnose your current state, plan the end goal, and get results. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain&#39;s Queen</h2><p>A court insider&#39;s portrait of Elizabeth II and her eventful and turbulent reign journeys beyond the facade of Buckingham Palace to answer questions about the scandal-ridden royals, relationships among members of her family, her personal beliefs, and future prospects for the House of Windsor. Tour.</p><p>&#34;There are two types of British queens,&#34; says Columbia University historian David Cannadine. There are those who hold the position strictly as wife of the king, such as Queen Caroline, the subject of a recent biography by Flora Fraser. Then there are those few who have ruled as sovereign in absence of a male heir. Among them, Queen Elizabeth II, who has ruled since the death of her father, George VI, in 1952. In her seven decades of life, she has witnessed the gradual decline of British importance and endured the public collapse of the marriages of her children. Yet she has visited more of the world than any sovereign in human history and lent dignity to her office.In the year of her 70th birthday, Elizabeth II of England comes under scrutiny as mother (not quite good enough), wife (better), and constitutional monarch (outstanding). Bradford's work falls into the category of molecular biography--pages of minutiae that very nearly bury the subject and leave the reader gasping for less. But apparently people can't get enough of the British Royals. Bradford (Splendours and Miseries: A Life of Sacheverell Sitwell, 1993, etc.), herself a viscountess, tells all, scandals included. The scandals range from the rumored involvement of Elizabeth's great-great- grandmother Queen Victoria with her servant John Brown to Elizabeth's youngest son's alleged affair with his valet. Detailed looks at the Duke of Windsor's abdication and the family bitterness it caused, Prince Philip's flings (no names, but titles--``a princess, a duchess, two or perhaps three countesses''--and more), and Princess Margaret's ``guttersnipe life'' are titillating and sometimes shocking to casual followers of the Windsor clan. Also scrutinized are the royal finances and the annual peregrinations to family holdings at Sandringham, Balmoral, and Windsor, as well as the fitting and refittings of the royal yacht Britannia, and the queen's fondness for racehorses and corgis. If it was Elizabeth's loose hand on the reins of her family that has contributed to the monarchy being blemished, it may be her dignity and commitment to her nation that saves it. Well informed and professional when she meets with her prime ministers {most of whom have ``fallen in love'' with her, according to Bradford), she works hard and successfully at her role as head of state, a model of ``courage, decency and a sense of duty'' through a period of tumultuous political and social change. No tabloid hype here, but this authoritative biography has enough revealing nuggets scattered through an otherwise flat narrative to keep a royal watcher enthralled.

Six-foot-two and every inch of her honest, Mary Lou "Dunk" Bateson is a coin appraiser at a New York auction house. She is forced to become an amateur detective when a prized Greek coin disappears from a collection that has been transferred to her company for auction. First treated as a prime suspect, Dunk determines to clear her name by ferreting out the real thief. In the process, she finds two interesting suitors in the cop and the insurance investigator who are assigned to the case, as well as encountering the bizarre family of Archibald Havistock, owner of the purloined coin. As she meets the Havistock household, Dunk uncovers scandal and perversity in the family closet, providing her with plenty of suspects. More lighthearted than Sanders's lurid crime novels, this is nonetheless far from a compelling spellbinder. Literary Guild selection; first serial to Cosmopolitan.

An earnest young academic, Daniel has come for a summer job cataloguing a private collector&#x2019;s library. But when Daniel&#x2019;s employer sends him to buy a stolen violin from a petty thief, a chain reaction of violence and deception ignites. Suddenly Daniel is drawn into a police investigation&#x2014;and a tempest swirling around a beautiful woman, a mysterious palazzo, and a lost musical masterpiece dating back centuries. With each step he takes, Daniel unwittingly retraces a journey that began in 1733, when another young man came to Venice. And when, in this realm of intrigue and beauty, two lovers came face-to-face with a killer&#x2014;and a mystery was born. Separated by centuries, two tales of passion, betrayal, and danger collide in David Hewson&#x2019;s dazzling novel. Sweeping us from the intrigue of Vivaldi&#x2019;s Venice to the gritty world of a modern cop, from the genius of a prodigy to the greed of a killer, <b>Lucifer&#x2019;s Shadow</b> builds to a shattering crescendo&#x2014;and one last, breathtaking surprise.</p><p>David Hewson has written five novels as well as several travel books. A weekly columnist for <i>The Sunday Times</i>, he lives in Kent, England, where he is currently working on his second novel featuring Nic Costa, <b>The Villa of Mysteries</b>. His first Nic Costa novel, <b>A Season for the Dead</b>, has recently been published by Delacorte Press.1<br>San Michele<br>He remembered to wear black. The cheap, thin suit from Standa. Shiny office shoes. A pair of fake Ray-Ban Predators stolen from some Japanese tourist straight off the coach at Piazzale Roma.<br><br>Rizzo lit a cigarette and waited by the gatehouse at San Michele. It was the first Sunday in July. The lagoon was entering summer, the change marked by the chittering of swallows above his head and a torpid heat rising from the water. A spirited breeze rippled the cypresses that dotted the cemetery like exclamation marks. In the shade of an alcove to his right, discreetly hidden, was an ordered stack of empty pine coffins. Rizzo watched something move in a beam of sunlight catching the corner of the nearest casket. A small lizard, dots running down its spine, dashed into the patch of gold, paused, then scurried back into the cracked brickwork.<br><br>Some job, Rizzo thought. Getting paid for checking up on a corpse.<br><br>The cemetery supervisor came out of his office and stared at the cigarette until Rizzo stamped it out. The man was short and fat, sweating in his bright white cotton shirt. He looked about forty, with a thick head of greasy hair and a weedy moustache like a comb snapped in half then stuck above a pair of fleshy lips.<br><br>"You got the papers?"<br><br>Rizzo nodded and tried to offer him half a smile. The supervisor wore a sour look, as if he suspected something was wrong. Rizzo was twenty-five but could pass for thirty dressed like this. Still, he guessed he looked a little young to be claiming possession of some stray cadaver, as if it were luggage left to be retrieved from a locker at the station.<br><br>He pulled out the documents the Englishman had given him that morning in the big, palatial apartment behind the Guggenheim Gallery. Massiter said they'd work. They'd cost enough.<br><br>"You're a relative?" the supervisor asked, staring at the lines of fine type on the page.<br><br>"Cousin," Rizzo replied.<br><br>"No other family?"<br><br>"All gone."<br><br>"Huh." The man folded up the papers and stuffed them in his pocket. "You could have waited another four weeks, you know. Ten years, they get. To the day. Seen plenty of people coming here late. Not seen many turn up early."<br><br>"Commitments."<br><br>The supervisor grimaced. "Sure. The dead got to fit themselves into your calendar. Not the other way round. Still . . ." He favoured Rizzo with a professional glance that might have harboured a grain of sympathy in it. "Least you're here. You'd be amazed how many of those poor things just never get claimed at all. Run up their decade in the ground and then we just take 'em to the public ossuary. No choice, you see. No room."<br><br>Everyone in Venice knew the score, Rizzo thought. If you wanted to be buried in San Michele, you had to follow the rules. The little island that sat between Murano and the northern shore of the city was full. The big names the tourists came to see could lie secure in their graves. Everyone else was on a temporary permit that lasted precisely ten years. Once the lease on that little plot of ground ran out, it was up to the relatives to take the bones elsewhere or leave the city to do the job for them.<br><br>The Englishman knew all about it too. For reasons Rizzo did not wish to know, he had fixed the disinterment papers early so he was the first to know what was in the box. Maybe there was someone else interested in this rotting corpse, someone who would stick to the ten-year deadline. Maybe not. Rizzo still didn't see the point. Was this to check there really was a body inside the casket? That had to be it. In truth, he didn't care. If the guy was willing to pay him two million lire just to flutter a couple of pages of forged paperwork around, he was more than happy. It made a change from lifting wallets in the crowds milling around San Marco.<br><br>"We have ways of doing this," the man said. "We like to do things nice and proper."<br><br>Rizzo followed him, past the tidy collection of shiny new coffins, out into the beating sun. They walked through the first section of the cemetery, where the dead had long-term residency, then on to an outlying area used for the relentless cycle of temporary burials. Green tarpaulins marked the areas where the current crop of bodies was being harvested. Each tiny headstone carried a photograph: young and old, frozen in a moment of time, looking at the camera as if they believed they would never die at all. They stopped by Recinto 1, Campo B, amid a fragrant ocean of flowers. The supervisor pointed to the headstone. On it was her name, reversed like all those in the cemetery: Gianni Susanna. Just turned eighteen when she died. The grave was empty, the earth freshly dug.<br><br>Her portrait sat in an oval frame attached to the marble headstone. Rizzo couldn't take his eyes off it. Susanna Gianni was as beautiful a girl as any he'd ever seen. The photograph must have been taken outside, on a sunny day, perhaps close to the time of her death. She didn't appear sick. She wore a purple T-shirt. Her long, dark hair fell to her shoulders. Her face and neck were tanned, her mouth set in a natural, open smile. She looked like a kid about to graduate from university, innocent, but with an expression in her gaze that said she'd been places, she knew a few tricks too. Rizzo closed his eyes behind the dark glasses and tried to still his thoughts. It was crazy, he knew, but he could feel himself hardening at the sight of this unknown girl who had died, of what he couldn't begin to guess, almost a decade before.<br><br>"You want the headstone?" The supervisor's voice cut through this sudden, half-scary, half-delicious reverie. "If you want it, you can take it away with the casket. I guess you organised a boat, huh?"<br><br>Rizzo didn't answer the questions. He pushed his hands deep into the pockets of his cheap jacket and held them in front of him, wondering if the man had noticed.<br><br>"Where is she?" he asked.<br><br>"Send the boatmen round. They know where to come."<br><br>"Where is she?" Rizzo repeated. The Englishman had been specific about what he wanted.<br><br>"We got a place." The supervisor said this with a sigh, as if he knew what was coming next.<br><br>"Show me."<br><br>Without a word, the man turned and headed for a deserted corner in the northern part of the cemetery. One of the big ferries destined for Burano and Torcello passed on the right. Gulls hung in the choppy air. A scattering of figures moved through the headstones, some with bouquets in their hands. Rizzo had been here only once before, with an old girlfriend, going to see her grandmama. The place spooked him. When he went, he wanted to go out in a puff of flame, a sudden fire inside the municipal crematorium on the mainland. Not lie around beneath the dry San Michele earth, waiting to be dug up a decade later.<br><br>They walked to a small, low building with a single tiny window. The supervisor fished a keychain out of his pocket and opened the door. Rizzo took off his sunglasses and followed him inside. Then he waited as the man threw the light switch, waited as his eyes adjusted to the abrupt transition from the piercing sunlight into the dark and then back into the thinner glare of the one fluorescent tube in the ceiling.<br><br>The coffin sat on a trestle in the middle of the room. The wood was a lifeless, flat grey colour. It was as if the thing, and what it contained, had been desiccated over the few years it had rested beneath the surface.<br><br>"Like I said," the man repeated, "send your men here. They'll know what to do. You don't want to watch. Believe me."<br><br>The Englishman had given his instructions.<br><br>"Open it."<br><br>The supervisor swore softly, folded his arms, and glowered into the dark corner beyond the casket. "No can do," he murmured. "What kind of game are you playing, kid?"<br><br>Rizzo reached into his pocket and pulled out two hundred euro notes. Massiter had known there might be incidentals along the way.<br><br>"Listen," he said. "The Giannis are a real close family. Just let me see my sweet little cousin one more time and then I'm on my way, OK?"<br><br>"Shit," the man said, then pocketed the notes and picked up a crowbar leaning against the wall. "You want me to take the lid off? Or do you feel so close to her you want to do that too?"<br><br>What Rizzo felt like was a cigarette. The tiny room was airless. A smell, musty and pervasive, was coming from the coffin. "Do it," he said, and nodded at the casket.<br><br>The man grunted, lifted the crowbar, and jammed it beneath the cover of the coffin. He barely looked at what he was doing. He'd popped these things a million times, Rizzo guessed. It was like working in a slaughterhouse or a morgue. After a while you never even thought about what was going on.<br><br>The iron worked its way around the wooden box slowly, lifting it just a few centimetres at a time, exposing the bent, rusty nails that held the thing together. The man completed a circle of the casket, then looked at Rizzo one final time.<br><br>"You sure about this, kid? A lot of you guys are real brave out there in the light of day, but it doesn't seem such a good idea when you're in here and it's time."<br><br>Rizzo didn't like being called "kid." Again he said, "Do it."<br><br>The supervisor carefully eased the bar beneath the cover, then pushed down, levering it open. The wood shattered into two pieces with a sudden, piercing crack. Rizzo jumped, in spite of himself. Dust and particles filled the air. Behind them came a persistent, noisome smell that was identifiably human in origin. Just one look, he thought. That was all the Englishman asked for.<br><br>He leaned over and peered into the casket. Her head was in the shadow cast by the corner of the box. The long hair was grey now, grey and fine and dry-l...</p><h2>Nova 1: Origin</h2><p>The new Human Rocket roars into action!

Despite being an &#x201c;imperfect commander&#x201d;&#x2013;and at times even a tactically suspect one&#x2013;Washington nevertheless possessed the requisite combination of vision, integrity, talents, and good fortune to lead America to victory in its war for independence.

If you have room on your bookshelf for only one book on the Revolution, this may be it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The Washington Times</i></p><p>Much has been written in the past two centuries about George Washington the statesman and "father of his country." Less often discussed is Washington's military career, including his exploits as a young officer and his performance as the Revolutionary War commander in chief. Now, in a revealing work of historical biography, Edward Lengel has written the definitive account of George Washington the soldier. <br>Based largely on Washington's personal papers, this engrossing book paints a vivid, factual portrait of a man to whom lore and legend so tenaciously cling. To Lengel, Washington was the imperfect commander. Washington possessed no great tactical ingenuity, and his acknowledged "brilliance in retreat" only demonstrates the role luck plays in the fortunes of all great men. He was not an enlisted man's leader; he made a point of never mingling with his troops. He was not an especially creative military thinker; he fought largely by the book. <br>He was not a professional, but a citizen soldier, who, at a time when warfare demanded that armies maneuver efficiently in precise formation, had little practical training handling men in combat. Yet despite his flaws, Washington was a remarkable figure, a true man of the moment, a leader who possessed a clear strategic, national, and continental vision, and who inspired complete loyalty from his fellow revolutionaries, officers, and enlisted men. America could never have won freedom without him. <br>A trained surveyor, Washington mastered topography and used his superior knowledge of battlegrounds to maximum effect. He appreciated the importance of good allies in times of crisis, and understood well the benefits of coordination of ground andnaval forces. Like the American nation itself, he was a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts-a remarkable everyman whose acts determined the course of history. Lengel argues that Washington's excellence was in his completeness, in how he united the military, political, and personal skills necessary to lead a nation in war and peace. <br>At once informative and engaging, and filled with some eye-opening revelations about Washington, the war for American independence, and the very nature of military command, General George Washington is a book that reintroduces readers to a figure many think they already know.EDWARD LENGEL is associate professor of history at the University of Virginia and associate editor of The Papers of George Washington.

And most of all Phaethon's quest is to regain ownership of the magnificent starship, the Phoenix Exultant, the most wonderful ship ever built, and to fly her to the stars.<br><br>It is an astounding story of super-science, a thrilling wonder story that recaptures the verve of SF's Golden Age writers <i>The Phoenix Exultant</i> is a suitably grand and stirring fulfillment of the promise shown in <i>The Golden Age</i> and confirms John C.

Wright, a journalist and a lawyer turned SF and fantasy writer, lives with his wife and son in Centreville, Virginia.<br>Phoenix Exultant, The<br>1THE CYBORG1.He opened the door onto a crowded boulevard of matter-shops, drama-spaces, reliquaries, shared-form communion theaters, colloquy-salons, and flower parks. An elaborate hydrosculpture of falls and aerial brooks spread from a central fountain works throughout the area, with running water held aloft by subatomic reorientations of its surface tension, so that arches and bows of shining transparency rose or fell, splashed or surged with careless indifference to the reality of gravity. Light, scattered from tall windows lining the concourse or from banners of advertisements or from high panels opening up into the regional mentality, was caught and made into rainbows by the high-flowing waters. Petals from floating water lilies drifted down across the scene.Beneath all this beauty was a crass ugliness. More than three-quarters of the people were present as mannequins. This was evidently a place meant for manorials, cryptics, or other schools that relied heavily on telepresentation. Since Phaethon no longer had access to any kind of sense-filter, all these folk, no matter how splendid of dress or elegant of comportment they might have appeared to an observer in the Surface Dreaming, looked to him like so many ranks and ranks of gray, dull, and faceless mannequins.There may have been beautiful music sweeping the area; excluded from the mentality, Phaethon was deaf to it. Here and there were hospice boxes or staging pools, ready to send out dreams orpartials, calls, messages, or any form of telepresentation. All channels were closed to Phaethon, and he was mute. There were dragon-signs burning like fire in the air, displaying messages of unknown import. Phaethon could not read the subtext or hypertext; Phaethon was illiterate. There may have been thought-guides in the Middle Dreaming to allow him to remember, as if he had always known, where to find the public transport he sought. Mnemonic assistance gone; Phaethon was an amnesiac. There may have been ornament and pageantry in the dream-stages gathered in the air around him, lovely beyond description, or signs and maps to show Phaethon where, in this wide concourse, might be the way or the road he sought. But Phaethon was blind.Here and there among the mannequins, the face of a realist or vivarianist showed. Their eyes turned dull when they lit on Phaethon, and their gazes slid past him without seeing. All sense-filters were tuned to exclude him. The world was blind to him as well.He expected the banners overhead to swoop down on him when he looked up. But no. They floated on by, shouting with lights and garish displays. Even the advertisements ignored him.No matter. Phaethon tried to keep his thoughts only on the next steps immediately before him. How to find out where he was? How to find Talaimannar? How to go from here to there? Once there, how to find out why Harrier Sophotech recommended that place?He had to ask someone for help, or directions.Phaethon stepped behind a stand of bushes; there was a flow of water from the fountain works overhead, forming a rippling, translucent ceiling. Was anyone watching? He assumed not.He doffed his armor and covered it with the cape of nanomaterial, which he then programmed to look like a hooded cloak. Phaethon himself merely drew out some of the nanomaterial from the black skin-garment he wore, and drew circles around his eyes, to solidify into a black domino mask. And that was that: Both of them were now in disguise. He hoped it was enough to fool at least a casual inspection. He programmed the suit to follow him at a fixed distance, avoiding obstacles; to "heel" as Daphne would have said.He stepped out again into the concourse, followed by the bulky, cloaked form of his armor, looming three paces behind him. Hewent downstairs and found a pondside esplanade that had fewer mannequins walking along it. He saw real faces; faces made of flesh or metal, or cobra scales, or polystructural material, or energy surfaces. They were laughing and talking, signaling and depicting. The air seemed charged with a carnival excitement. Many people skipped or danced as they strolled, moved by music Phaethon could not hear. Others dived over the side of the esplanade, to glide among the buildings and statues in the pond.He did not know what particular event was being celebrated. It was rare to see so many folk together. Whatever bunting or decoration swam in the dreamspace here, which might have given him a clue as to the nature of the occasion, was, of course, invisible to him.People smiled and nodded at him as they walked by, full of good cheer. "Merry Millennium! May you live a thousand years!"He had not realized how much he had missed, and was going to miss, the sight of friendly human faces. Phaethon smiled back, waving, and calling out, "And a thousand years to you!"Phaethon reminded himself that he had to be careful. Theoretically, the masquerade protocol would not protect him, since he was no longer part of the celebration, no longer part of the community. But how many people would even try to read his identity if they saw him wearing a mask during a masquerade? Most people, Phaethon guessed, would not.The rule from the Hortators was that no one was to give him aid, comfort, food or drink, or shelter, sell him goods or services, or buy from him, or donate charity to him. This rule did not (in theory) actually prohibit speaking to him, or looking at him and smiling, although that was the way it surely would be practiced.If Phaethon tried to buy something from a passerby, Aurelian was obligated to warn him that he was about to be contaminated with exile. But as long as Phaethon did not try to win from the passersby either food or drink or comfort or shelter or charity, Aurelian would no doubt stand mute. Sophotechs had a long, long tradition of failing to volunteer any information that had not been specifically asked.It was hard. A couple walking hand in hand were passing outwedding-album projections of their future children. Phaethon smiled but declined to take one. A young girl (or someone dressed as one), skipping and licking a floating balloon-pastry offered him a bite; Phaethon patted her on the head, but did not touch her pastry. When a laughing wine-juggler, surrounded by musical firecrackers, and balancing on a ball, rolled by and tried to thrust a glass of champaign into Phaethon's hand, Phaethon was not able to refuse except by jerking his hand away.The juggler frowned, wondering at Phaethon's lack of courtesy, and raised two fingers as if to try to find out who Phaethon really was. But the juggler was distracted when a slender, naked gyno-morph, fluttering with a hundred stimulation scarves, jumped up in drunken passion to embrace him. Singing a carol to Aphrodite, the two rolled off together, while the juggler's bottles and goblets fell this way and that.Phaethon let the throng carry him down the esplanade.The pressure of the crowd eased when Phaethon came to a line of windows, two hundred feet tall or more, which looked out upon a balcony larger than a boulevard. Out onto the balcony they all went together. Phaethon climbed up a pedestal holding a statue of Orpheus in his pose as Father of the Second Immortality. The stone hands held up a symbol in the shape of a snake swallowing its own tail. Phaethon put his foot in the stone coils of the serpent and pulled himself high, looking left and right above the heads of the crowd.Several lesser towers and small skyscrapers grew up from the railing of the balcony, like little corals fringing the topless super-tower of the space elevator.Beyond the balcony, the metropolis spread out from the mountain-base of the space elevator in three concentric circles. Innermost and oldest, the center circle consisted of huge windowless structures shaped according to simple geometries; giant cubes, hemispheres, and hemicylinders, painted in bright, primary colors, connected by rectilinear motion-lines and smart roads. The architecture followed the Objective Aesthetic, with the building shapes, slabs, and plaques all rigidly stereotyped. There was little movement in this part of the city; human beings of the basic neuroformtended to find these faceless buildings and looming monoliths intolerable. Mostly, this central ring housed Sophotech components, warehouses, manufacturies. Invariants, who had little desire for beauty or pleasure or inefficiency, lived here, dwelling in square dormitories arranged like rank upon rank of coffin-beds.The second ring was done in the Standard Aesthetic. Here were black pools and lakes of nanomachinery, with many brooks and rills, touched with white foam of the dark material streaming from one to another. Tiny waterfalls of the material formed where cascade-separator stages mixed and organized the components. Each lake was surrounded by the false-trees and coral bioformations of na-nomanufactory. A hundred solar parasols raised orchidlike colors to the sun. The houses and presence chambers were formed of strange growthlike seashells; one spiral after another, shining with lambent mother-of-pearl, rose to the skyline. Blue-black, dark pearl, glinting silver, and dappled blue-gray hues dominated the scene. Thought-gardens, coven places, and sacred circles dotted the area, along with nymphariums, mother trees, and staging pools. Warlocks and basics tended to prefer the chaotic fractals and organic shapes of the Standard Aesthetic. Wide areas of garden space were occupied by the decentralized bodies of Cerebellines.Beyond this, on the hills surrounding, green arbors and white mansions prevailed. This was the Consensus Aesthetic, patronized mostly by manor-born and first-generation basics. Greek columns marched along the hilltops; formal English gardens rested in green shadows before grand houses done in the Georgian style, or neo-Roman, or stern Alexandrian.In the far distance, Phaethon saw a wide lake. On the lake were a hundred shapes like jewel-armored clipper ships, whose sails were textured like a dozen wings of butterflies, surrounded with light.Now Phaethon knew where he was. This city was Kisumu, south of Aetheopia, overlooking Lake Victoria. And Phaethon understood the wonder and excitement of the crowd. For the huge shapes in the lake were the Deep Ones.These were the last of the once-great race of the Jovian half-warlocks, a unique neuroform that combined elements from the Cerebellineand Warlock nervous-system structures. Once, they rode the storms and swam in the pressurized methane atmosphere of Jupiter, before its ignition. When the time came to end their way of life, they chose instead to enter whalelike bodies and to sleep at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, where they called back and forth to each other, and wove songs and sonar images relating to the vast, sad, and ancient emotions known only to them; and made sounds in the deep, which reminded them, but could not recapture, those songs and sensations their old Jupiter-adapted Behemoth bodies once had made in the endless atmosphere of that gas-giant planet.Once every thousand years, only during the time of the Millennium, they woke from their dreams of sorrow, grew festive gems and multicolored membranes and sails along their upper hulls, rose to the surface, and sang in the air.By an ancient contract, no recordings could be made of their great songs, nor was anyone allowed to speak of what they heard or dreamed when that music swept over them.No wonder so many people were here in reality.Phaethon's heart was in his throat. The songs of the Deep Ones he had only heard once before, since he had not attended this ceremony his second millennial masquerade, during Argentorium's tenure. That time once before, three thousand years ago (during the tenure of Cuprician) the song had sung to him of vastness, emptiness, and a sense of infinite promise. It was as if Phaethon had been plunged into the wide expanses of the Jovian cloudscape; or into the far wider expanses of the stars beyond.The Deep Ones had originally been designed also to serve as living spaceships, able to swim the radiation-filled and dust-filled vacuum between the Jovian moons, able to tolerate the almost unthinkable re-entry heat of low-orbit dives down into the Jovian atmosphere. But the early successes in cleaning circumjovial space and in taming the Jovian magnetosphere, made those space-lanes safe and economical for ships of ordinary construction; the emplacements of sky hooks made alarming re-entries unnecessary. The Deep Ones' way of life was past; the danger and romance of space travel was removed. Phaethon had heard all of this in their song,so long ago. It had planted the seed that blossomed into his own desire to embrace his dream of star travel.It had been Daphne who had brought him to hear it. But had that been Daphne Prime, or her ambassador-doll, Daphne Tercius? Phaethon could not remember. Perhaps his lack of useful sleep was beginning to affect his memory.Phaethon jumped down from the pedestal and began to push his way through the crowd, and away. For the Deep Ones did not give away their grand, sad music freely. Everyone who did not exclude the music from his sense filter would have a fee charged to his account; and, when the computers detected that Phaethon could not pay, he would be unmasked. Once Phaethon was unmasked, no one, of course, would help him. Not to mention that the performance would be delayed, and the afternoon spoiled for everyone. (He was amazed to discover that he still cared about the convenience and pleasure of his fellowmen, even though they had ostracized him. But the wonder of that first Deep One symphony he had once heard still haunted his memory. He did not want to diminish the joy of folk happier than he.)The crowd thinned as he rounded the space elevator, and came to the side facing away from the lake. Several dirigible airships, as large as whales themselves, were docked with their noses touching the towers rising from the balcony sides. They had dragon-signs in the air, displaying their routes and times in a format Phaethon could not read.Phaethon stopped a passerby, a woman dressed as a pyretic. "Pardon me, miss, but my companion and I are looking for the way to Talaimannar." He gestured toward the hooded and cloaked figure of his armor, standing silently behind him. He spoke what was not quite a lie: "My companion and I are involved in a masquerade game of hunt-and-seek, and we are not allowed to access the mentality. Could you tell me how to find the nearest smart road?"She cocked her head at him. Her dancing eyes were surrounded by wreaths of flame, and smoke curled from her lips when she smiled. When she spoke, Phaethon had no routine to translate her words into his language and grammar and logic.He tried more simply: "Talaimannar ... ? Talaimannar ... ? Smart road?" He pantomimed sliding along a frictionless surface, hands waving, so that she giggled.By her emphatic gesture he understood she meant that the smart roads were not running; she pointed him toward a nearby airship and pushed him lightly on the shoulder, as if to say, Go! Go!Phaethon froze. Had she just helped him, or offered him passage on some ship owned by her? There was no alarm in her eyes; to judge from her expression, there was no secret voice from Aurelian warning her. And the woman was turning away, drawn by the movement of the crowd. Evidently she was not the owner.Phaethon ...</p><h2>10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World</h2><p>Brand New, Perfect Condition, allow 3-9 business days for standard shipping.

Tomas Graves was born in and belongs to Majorca. His father, the great love poet Robert Graves, famously ended up on the beautiful Mediterranean island pretty much by accident, but it is the happiest accident of Tomas&#39; life. His love for the special beauties of Majorcan culture shines on every page of this infectiously happy book. This is the real Majorca. &#39;Tuning Up at Dawn&#39; examines both the suppression and renaissance of the ancient native culture -- above all, its music. Graves is a musician himself, and his own musical escapades give the book its brilliantly distinctive tone. A host of musicians -- Jimi Hendrix, Kevin Ayers, Bob Geldof, Sinead O&#39;Connor and Eurovision contestants -- have stayed in Majorca and provide the soundtrack to this rhythmic, irresistible tour around a magical island and its magical culture.</p><p>Tomas Graves is the son of Robert Graves. He lives in Deia, on the north coast of Majorca. He is a graphic designer, printer, musician and author of the acclaimed cookbook Bread and Oil.Praise for `Tuning Up At Dawn&#39;: `Modest and amusing, deceptively intelligent and witty...the best book in English on Spain since Gerald Brenan&#39;s classic South From Granada.&#39; Robert Carver, Daily Mail `...rolling, informal, anecdotal, colloquial.&#39; Daily Telegraph Praise for `Bread and Oil&#39;: `A book born out of obsession and filled like a scrapbook with wit and wisdom.&#39; Anthony Sattin, Sunday Times `A work of some scholarship.

Donnelly, Jr</b>, is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. One of the most prolific and wide-ranging historians of Ireland, he is the author of <i>The Land and the People of Nineteenth-Century Cork,</i> which was awarded the Herbert Baxter Adams Prize of the American Historical Association). He is a coeditor of the journal <i>Eire-Ireland</i>.The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s, one of the major human catastrophes of modern times, has been popularly perceived as a genocide attributable to the British government's actions and failures to act. In professional historical circles, however, such thinking was dismissed for many years, as evidenced by the scathing academic response to Cecil Woodham-Smith's 1963 classic, The Great Hunger: Ireland, 1845-49, which, in addition to presenting a vivid and horrifying picture of the human suffering, made strong accusations against the British government and its officials. Donnelly (Irish history, Univ. of Wisconsin) has written an intelligent, thought-provoking, and well-written book that, among other things, is a very useful survey and synthesis of the current debates about and researches into the origins and causes of the famine. Donnelly supports Cecil-Woodham's charges of British governmental sins of both omission and commission in the famine but puts those charges in a broader context, including discussion of class and regional influences on the famine in Ireland itself. The chapter notes, indexing, and bibliography are of good quality. This book would be an excellent choice to accompany and update The Great Hunger. Highly recommended for both academic and public libraries.

However, less is known about the women who also risked their lives for Britain and the liberation of France. By 1942 SOE was in desperate need of new recruits for their dangerous missions in France and they turned to a previously unexplored group&#x2014;women. These female recruits came from all levels of society and were often motivated by an idealistic love of France and a desire to play a part in its liberation. Many displayed unexpected qualities. Some proved good leaders, like Pearl Witherington, others like Nancy Wake laughed their way through the war, many others like Noor Inayat Khan showed astonishing courage through terrible privations, and many of them died bravely and painfully. Without doubt their contributions to secret missions of resistance and sabotage saved numerous lives.

The first and only authorized book about the band, <b>The Phish Book</b> is an extraordinary verbal and visual chronicle of a year in the life of Phish, featuring extensive interviews with the four band members--Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon, and Page McConnell--conducted by writer Richard Gehr, who also serves as guide to the history, mythology, musical context, and unique audience-band relationship in which the Vermont quartet flourishes.<br><br>While it contains many of the trappings of other lavish rock monuments--including more than two hundred pieces of previously unpublished art and photography from the band's private archive--<b>The Phish Book</b> raises the form to a higher level by means of an innovative roundtable-style discussion format. Richard Gehr and Phish use the events of 1997 as a jumping-off point from which the band members free-associate about themselves, their music, and the dedicated and colorful community that springs up wherever they perform.<br><br>Beginning with the backstage scene at Boston's Fleet Center on New Year's Eve, 1996, <b>The Phish Book</b> explores the band's earliest days in Burlington, Vermont; their musical influences, which include James Brown, Frank Zappa, and the Grateful Dead; their legendary Halloween shows; the two European and two American tours the group undertook in 1997; the stories behind their 1996 studio album Billy Breathes and the following year's live Slip Stitch and Pass; life onstage and off; the sixty-thousand-fan Maine campout and art project known as the Great Went; and the experimental recording and performing techniques that informed the band's most recent studio album, The Story of the Ghost. <br><br>More than a journal of the group's evolution over the course of a single year, <b>The Phish Book</b> is a glorious snapshot of a band much bigger than its parts and at the height of its collective power.</p><p>With pride, drummer Jon Fishman explains the level of success that his quirky, experimental roots-rock quartet has achieved: "We've reached the point where it's cool to hate us." As you might expect from this eclectic band, such a metric speaks louder than the legions of Phish fans that follow the quartet from town to town.<p> Cowriter Richard Gehr describes this enlightening book as "a studio edit of Phish in real-time conversation." Along with Fishman, Page McConnell, Mike Gordon, and Trey Anastasio are revealed in their own words, the result of a spate of interviews conducted by Gehr between 1996's New Year's Eve show at Boston's Fleet Center and 1997's year-end Madison Square Garden run. Much like a Phish show, the conversation rambles back and forth, and the complete portrait of the band only emerges subtly and indirectly, although it certainly does emerge. Most rewarding is when they discuss the process of performing and creating music. They describe "onstage love affairs" between two of the four, and how certain members basically ignored others for years at a time and then finally "discovered" them after a decade of playing together. Some may be happy to know that even Phish own up to the unevenness (read: boredom) of some of their extended musical journeys.</p><p> In many ways, <i>The Phish Book</i> serves as a gift to die-hard fans, often diving into some of the band's more esoteric mythology: the origins of songs and lyrics, the various recording processes, the Dude of Life, and so on. The treasure-trove of photos includes shots of bars and stadiums, onstage and backstage, giant flying hot dogs, fans clothed and not, Fishman clothed and not. But the uninitiated can gain much-needed perspective from this enjoyable book as well. They'll learn how Phish find a connection between all styles of music, and use this connection (implied or otherwise) to inform their own music. And they might be surprised to discover how much substance there is behind the twirling fans and endless jams. <i>--Marc Greilsamer</i></p><b>Richard Gehr</b> is an Oregon writer who lives in Brooklyn.

Setsu Shigematsu&#x2019;s book is the first to present a sustained history of <i>&#x16b;man ribu</i>&#x2019;s formation, its political philosophy, and its contributions to feminist politics across and beyond Japan. Through an in-depth analysis of <i>&#x16b;man ribu</i>, Shigematsu furthers our understanding of Japan&#x2019;s gender-based modernity and imperialism and expands our perspective on transnational liberation and feminist movements worldwide. </p><p>In <i>Scream from the Shadows</i>, Shigematsu engages with political philosophy while also contextualizing the movement in relation to the Japanese left and New Left as well as the anti&#x2013;Vietnam War and radical student movements. She examines the controversial figure Tanaka Mitsu, <i>&#x16b;man ribu</i>&#x2019;s most influential activist, and the movement&#x2019;s internal dynamics. Shigematsu highlights <i>&#x16b;man ribu</i>&#x2019;s distinctive approach to the relationship of women&#x2014;and women&#x2019;s liberation&#x2014;to violence: specifically, the movement&#x2019;s embrace of violent women who were often at the margins of society and its recognition of women&#x2019;s complicity in violence against other women. </p><p><i>Scream from the Shadows</i> provides a powerful case study of a complex and contradictory movement with a radical vision of women&#x2019;s liberation. It offers a unique opportunity to reflect on the blind spots within our contemporary and dominant views of feminism across their liberal, marxist, radical, Euro-American, postcolonial, and racial boundaries.<br></p></p><p><p>Setsu Shigematsu is assistant professor of media and cultural studies at the University of California, Riverside.

Bracingly candid and self-reflective, <i>Scream from the Shadows </i>speaks directly to the post-9-11 moment of liberal feminism&#x2019;s affinity with militarized and other modes of state violence.

Sinyai shows how America's working people and union leaders debated the first questions of democratic theory&#x2015;and in the process educated themselves about the rights and responsibilities of democratic citizenship.</p><p>In tracing the course of the American labor movement from the founding of the Knights of Labor in the 1870s to the 1968 presidential election and its aftermath, Sinyai explores the political dimensions of collective bargaining, the structures of unions and businesses, and labor's relationships with political parties and other social movements. <i>Schools of Democracy</i> analyzes how labor activists wrestled with fundamental aspects of political philosophy and the development of American democracy, including majority rule versus individual liberty, the rule of law, and the qualifications required of citizens of a democracy. Offering a balanced assessment of mainstream leaders of American labor, from Samuel Gompers to George Meany, and their radical critics, including the Socialists and the Industrial Workers of the World, Sinyai provides an unusual and refreshing perspective on American labor history.</p></p><p>"Liberals and conservatives alike should read this book as a useful reminder that true democracy in America depends on the freedom of working people to form independent organizations and have a real voice in decisions about our future. Schools of Democracy documents the fact that America&#x2019;s promise to value and reward work has been kept only when working families have had strong, democratic unions that can hold corporations and government accountable."&#x2014;Andrew L. Stern, President, Service Employees International Union <p>"Schools for Democracy is a fresh and compelling reinterpretation of U.S. labor history from a political rather than an economic standpoint. Sinyai restores American workers and their unions to their rightful place as key defenders of democratic government and the educated, active citizenry upon which it rests. His book also has the singular merit of treating Samuel Gompers, together with other labor leaders, as the important political figures and public intellectuals that they were."&#x2014;Dorothy Sue Cobble, author of The Other Women&#x2019;s Movement: Workplace Justice and Social Rights in Modern America </p><p>"Schools of Democracy is lucid, thorough, and written with confidence and humor. It surveys a wide range of labor history. Clayton Sinyai subjects familiar markers in labor history&#x2014;the Knights of Labor, the rise of the AFL, the emergence of the CIO, and postwar labor history&#x2014;to a new standard: how unions legitimated themselves according to democratic theory."&#x2014;Alan L. Draper, St. Lawrence University</p><p>Clayton Sinyai is a Researcher for the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) and Political Director for Laborers' Local 11.</p></p><h2>The Tortilla Curtain</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.</p><p>T.C.

This wasn&#x2019;t a statistic in an actuarial table tucked away in a drawer somewhere, this wasn&#x2019;t random and impersonal. It had happened to him, Delaney Mossbacher, of 32 Pi�on Drive, Arroyo Blanco Estates, a liberal humanist with an unblemished driving record and a freshly waxed Japanese car with personalized plates, and it shook him to the core. Everywhere he turned he saw those red-flecked eyes, the rictus of the mouth, the rotten teeth and incongruous shock of gray in the heavy black brush of the mustache&#x2014;they infested his dreams, cut through his waking hours like a window on another reality. He saw his victim in a book of stamps at the post office, reflected in the blameless glass panels of the gently closing twin doors at Jordan&#x2019;s elementary school, staring up at him from his omelette aux fines herbes at Emilio&#x2019;s in the shank of the evening.</p><p>The whole thing had happened so quickly. One minute he was winding his way up the canyon with a backseat full of newspapers, mayonnaise jars and Diet Coke cans for the recycler, thinking nothing, absolutely nothing, and the next thing he knew the car was skewed across the shoulder in a dissipating fan of dust. The man must have been crouching in the bushes like some feral thing, like a stray dog or bird-mauling cat, and at the last possible moment he&#x2019;d flung himself across the road in a mad suicidal scramble. There was the astonished look, a flash of mustache, the collapsing mouth flung open in a mute cry, and then the brake, the impact, the marimba rattle of the stones beneath the car, and finally, the dust. The car had stalled, the air conditioner blowing full, the voice on the radio nattering on about import quotas and American jobs. The man was gone. Delaney opened his eyes and unclenched his teeth. The accident was over, already a moment in history.</p><p>To his shame, Delaney&#x2019;s first thought was for the car (was it marred, scratched, dented?), and then for his insurance rates (what was this going to do to his good-driver discount?), and finally, belatedly, for the victim. Who was he? Where had he gone? Was he all right? Was he hurt? Bleeding? Dying? Delaney&#x2019;s hands trembled on the wheel. He reached mechanically for the key and choked off the radio. It was then, still strapped in and rushing with adrenaline, that the reality of it began to hit him: he&#x2019;d injured, possibly killed, another human being. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault, god knew&#x2014;the man was obviously insane, demented, suicidal, no jury would convict him&#x2014;but there it was, all the same. Heart pounding, he slipped out from under the seat belt, eased open the door and stepped tentatively onto the parched strip of naked stone and litter that constituted the shoulder of the road.</p><p>Immediately, before he could even catch his breath, he was brushed back by the tailwind of a string of cars racing bumper-to-bumper up the canyon like some snaking malignant train. He clung to the side of his car as the sun caught his head in a hammerlock and the un-air-conditioned heat rose from the pavement like a fist in the face, like a knockout punch. Two more cars shot by. He was dizzy. Sweating. He couldn&#x2019;t seem to control his hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had an accident,&#x201d; he said to himself, repeating it over and over like a mantra, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had an accident.&#x201d;</p><p>But where was the victim? Had he been flung clear, was that it? Delaney looked round him helplessly. Cars came down the canyon, burnished with light; cars went up it; cars turned into the lumberyard a hundred yards up on the right and into the side street beyond it, whining past him as if he didn&#x2019;t exist. One after another the faces of the drivers came at him, shadowy and indistinct behind the armor of their smoked-glass windshields. Not a head turned. No one stopped.</p><p>He walked round the front of the car first, scanning the mute unrevealing brush along the roadside&#x2014;ceanothus, chamise, redshanks&#x2014;for some sign of what had happened. Then he turned to the car. The plastic lens over the right headlight was cracked and the turn-signal housing had been knocked out of its track, but aside from that the car seemed undamaged. He threw an uneasy glance at the bushes, then worked his way along the passenger side to the rear, expecting the worst, the bleeding flesh and hammered bone, sure now that the man must have been trapped under the car. Stooping, palm flat, one knee in the dirt, he forced himself to look. Crescendo and then release: nothing there but dust and more dust.</p><p>The license plate&#x2014;PILGRIM&#x2014;caught the sun as he rose and clapped the grit from his hands, and he looked to the bushes yet again. &#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; he cried suddenly over the noise of the cars flashing by in either direction. &#x201c;Is anybody there? Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>He turned slowly round, once, twice, as if he&#x2019;d forgotten something&#x2014;a set of keys, his glasses, his wallet&#x2014;then circled the car again. How could no one have seen what had happened? How could no one have stopped to help, bear witness, gape, jeer&#x2014;anything? A hundred people must have passed by in the last five minutes and yet he might as well have been lost in the Great Painted Desert for all the good it did him. He looked off up the road to the bend by the lumberyard and the grocery beyond it, and saw the distant figure of a man climbing into a parked car, the hard hot light exploding round him. And then, fighting down the urge to run, to heave himself into the driver&#x2019;s seat and burn up the tires, to leave the idiot to his fate and deny everything&#x2014;the date, the time, the place, his own identity and the sun in the sky&#x2014;Detaney turned back to the bushes. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; he called again.</p><p>Nothing. The cars tore past. The sun beat at his shoulders, his neck, the back of his head.</p><p>To the left, across the road, was a wall of rock; to the right, the canyon fell off to the rusty sandstone bed of Topanga Creek, hundreds of feet below. Delaney could see nothing but brush and treetops, but he knew now where his man was&#x2014;down there, down in the scrub oak and manzanita. The high-resin-compound bumper of the Acura had launched that sad bundle of bone and gristle over the side of the canyon like a Ping-Pong ball shot out of a cannon, and what chance was there to survive that? He felt sick suddenly, his brain mobbed with images from the eyewitness news&#x2014;shootings, stabbings, auto wrecks, the unending parade of victims served up afresh each day&#x2014;and something hot and sour rose in his throat. Why him? Why did this have to happen to him?</p><p>He was about to give it up and jog to the lumberyard for help, for the police, an ambulance&#x2014;they&#x2019;d know what to do&#x2014;when a glint of light caught his eye through the scrim of brush. He staggered forward blindly, stupidly, like a fish to a lure&#x2014;he wanted to do the right thing, wanted to help, he did. But almost as quickly, he caught himself. This glint wasn&#x2019;t what he&#x2019;d expected&#x2014;no coin or crucifix, no belt buckle, key chain, medal or steel-toed boot wrenched from the victim&#x2019;s foot&#x2014;just a shopping cart, pocked with rust and concealed in the bushes beside a rough trail that plunged steeply down the hillside, vanishing round a right-angle bend no more than twenty feet away.</p><p>Delaney called out again. Cupped his hands and shouted. And then he straightened up, wary suddenly, catlike and alert. At five-foot-nine and a hundred and sixty-five pounds, he was compact, heavy in the shoulders and with a natural hunch that made him look as if he were perpetually in danger of pitching forward on his face, but he was in good shape and ready for anything. What startled him to alertness was the sudden certainty that the whole thing had been staged&#x2014;he&#x2019;d read about this sort of operation in the Metro section, gangs faking accidents and then preying on the unsuspecting, law-abiding, compliant and fully insured motorist ... But then where was the gang? Down the path? Huddled round the bend waiting for him to take that first fatal step off the shoulder and out of sight of the road?</p><p>He might have gone on speculating for the rest of the afternoon, the vanishing victim a case for <i>Unsolved Mysteries</i> or the Home Video Network, if he hadn&#x2019;t become aware of the faintest murmur from the clump of vegetation to his immediate right. But it was more than a murmur&#x2014;it was a deep aching guttural moan that made something catch in his throat, an expression of the most primitive and elemental experience we know: pain. Delaney&#x2019;s gaze jumped from the shopping cart to the path and then to the bush at his right, and there he was, the man with the red-flecked eyes and graying mustache, the daredevil, the suicide, the jack-in-the-box who&#x2019;d popped up in front of his bumper and ruined his afternoon. The man was on his back, limbs dangling, as loose-jointed as a doll flung in a corner by an imperious little girl. A trail of blood, thick as a finger, leaked from the corner of his mouth, and Delaney couldn&#x2019;t remember ever having seen anything so bright. Two eyes, dull with pain, locked on him like a set of jaws.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you ... are you okay?&#x201d; Delaney heard himself say.</p><p>The man winced, tried to move his head. Delaney saw now that the left side of the man&#x2019;s face&#x2014;the side that had been turned away from him&#x2014;was raw, scraped and flensed like a piece of meat stripped from the hide. And then he noticed the man&#x2019;s left arm, the torn shirtsleeve and the skin beneath it stippled with blood and bits of dirt and leaf mold, and the blood-slick hand that clutched a deflated paper bag to his chest. Slivers of glass tore through the bag like claws and orange soda soaked the man&#x2019;s khaki shirt; a plastic package, through which. Delaney could make out a stack of <i>tortillas (Como Hechas a Mano),</i> clung to the man&#x2019;s crotch as if fastened there.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; Delaney breathed, gesturing futilely, wondering whether to reach down a hand or not&#x2014;should he be moved? Could he? &#x201c;I mean, I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2014;why did you run out like that? What possessed you? Didn&#x2019;t you see me?&#x201d;</p><p>Flies hovered in the air. The canyon stretched out before them, slabs of upthrust stone and weathered tumbles of rock, light and shadow at war. The man tried to collect himself. He kicked out his legs like an insect pinned to a mounting board, and then his eyes seemed to sharpen, and with a groan he struggled to a sitting position. He said something then in a foreign language, a gargle and rattle in the throat, and Delaney didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t French he was speaking, that was for sure. And it wasn&#x2019;t Norwegian. The United States didn&#x2019;t share a two-thousand-mile border with France&#x2014;or with Norway either. The man was Mexican, Hispanic, that&#x2019;s what he was, and he was speaking Spanish, a hot crazed drumroll of a language to which Delaney&#x2019;s four years of high-school French gave him little access. <i>&#x201c;Docteur?&#x201d;</i> he tried.</p><p>The man&#x2019;s face was a blank. Blood trickled steadily from the corner of his mouth, camouflaged by the mustache. He wasn&#x2019;t as young as Delaney had first thought, or as slight&#x2014;the shirt was stretched tight across his shoulders and there was a visible swelling round his middle, just above the package of <i>tortillas.</i> There was gray in his hair too. The man grimaced and sucked in his breath, displaying a mismatched row of teeth that were like pickets in a rotting fence. <i>&#x201c;No quiero un matasanos,&#x201d;</i> he growled, wincing as he staggered to his feet in a cyclone of twigs, dust and crushed tumbleweed, <i>&#x201c;no lo necesito.&#x201d;</i></p><p>For a long moment they stood there, examining each other, unwitting perpetrator and unwitting victim, and then the man let the useless bag drop from his fingers with a tinkle of broken glass. It lay at his feet in the dirt, and they both stared at it, frozen in time, until he reached down absently to retrieve the <i>tortillas,</i> which were still pinned to the crotch of his pants. He seemed to shake himself then, like a dog coming out of a bath, and as he clutched the <i>tortillas</i> in his good hand, he bent forward woozily to hawk a gout of blood into the dirt.</p><p>Delaney felt the relief wash over him&#x2014;the man wasn&#x2019;t going to die, he wasn&#x2019;t going to sue, he was all right and it was over. &#x201c;Can I do anything for you?&#x201d; he asked, feeling charitable now. &#x201c;I mean, give you a ride someplace or something?&#x201d; Delaney pointed to the car. He held his fists up in front of his face and pantomimed the act of driving. <i>&#x201c;Dans la voiture?&#x201d;</i></p><p>The man spat again. The left side of his face glistened in the harsh sunlight, ugly and wet with fluid, grit, pills of flesh and crushed vegetation. He looked at Delaney as if he were an escaped lunatic. &#x201c;Dooo?&#x201d; he echoed.</p><p>Delaney shuffled his feet. The heat was getting to him. He pushed the glasses back up the bridge of his nose. He gave it one more try: &#x201c;You know&#x2014;<i>help.</i> Can I help you?&#x201d;</p><p>And then the man grinned, or tried to. A film of blood clung to the jagged teeth and he licked it away with a flick of his tongue. &#x201c;Monee?&#x201d; he whispered, and he rubbed the fingers of his free hand together.</p><p>&#x201c;Money,&#x201d; Delaney repeated, &#x201c;okay, yes, money,&#x201d; and he reached for his wallet as the sun drilled the canyon and the cars sifted by and a vulture, high overhead, rode the hot air rising from below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Delaney didn&#x2019;t remember getting back into the car, but somehow he found himself steering, braking and applying gas as he followed a set of taillights up the canyon, sealed in and impervious once again. He drove in a daze, hardly conscious of the air conditioner blasting in his face, so wound up in his thoughts that he went five blocks past the recycling center before realizing his error, and then, after making a questionable U-turn against two lanes of oncoming traffic, he forgot himself again and drove past the place in the opposite direction. It was over. Money had changed hands, there were no witnesses, and the man was gone, out of his life forever. And yet, no matter how hard he tried, Delaney couldn&#x2019;t shake the image of him.</p><p>He&#x2019;d given the man twenty dollars&#x2014;it seemed the least he could do&#x2014;and the man had stuffed the bill quickly into the pocket of his cheap stained pants, sucked in his breath and turned away without so much as a nod or gesture of thanks. Of course, he was probably in shock. Delaney was no doctor, but the guy had looked pretty shaky&#x2014;and his face was a mess, a real mess. Leaning forward to hold out the bill, Delaney had watched, transfixed, as a fly danced away from the abraded flesh along the line of the man&#x2019;s jaw, and another, fat-bodied and black, settled in to take its place. In that moment the strange face before him was transformed, annealed in the brilliant merciless light, a hard cold wedge of a face that looked strangely loose in its coppery skin, the left cheekbone swollen and misaligned&#x2014;was it bruised? Broken ? Or was that the way it was supposed to look? Before Delaney could decide, the man had turned abruptly away, limping off down the path with an exaggerated stride that would have seemed comical under other circumstances&#x2014;Delaney could think of nothing so much as Charlie Chaplin walking off some imaginary hurt&#x2014;an...</p></p><h2>Death&#39;s Angel: Lost Angels Book 3</h2><p><i><b>Since the beginning of time, the archangels have longed to know true love.

Heather's educational background includes religious studies, archeology, and law. She has traveled all over the world but hopes to one day live in a town with a world-class hockey team. (Let's go Pens!)Azrael smiled, flashing perfect white teeth that sported incisors slightly longer than the norm. Some people naturally looked like that, he knew, but on him it looked different enough that he didn&#x2019;t smile often. On him, it seemed to fit too perfectly and only served to reinforce the otherworldly impressions people often had when looking at him.<p>He was a starkly charismatic individual. He was taller than anyone he knew, save perhaps Samael. His voice could literally mesmerize. He was also uncommonly, almost painfully handsome. He wasn&#x2019;t certain why the Old Man had seen fit to bother with such a thing while simultaneously making him a vampire. It was like the curse of Beethoven, who created the most beautiful music in the world and couldn&#x2019;t hear it. What good was a beautiful face when placed on a monster?</p><p>But Sophie didn&#x2019;t seem to mind the hint of fang he exposed. In fact, as he brushed her mind, unable to help himself from drawing nearer to her in any way possible, he was surprised to find that she found it attractive. <i>My God</i>, she thought. <i>He really does look like a vampire.</i></p><p>This was the second time she had thought such a thing. If he&#x2019;d been capable of choking, he would have done so the first time her mind had muttered the impression. Hearing it now had nearly as strong an effect on Azrael. Sophie wasn&#x2019;t repulsed by vampires. And the idea that he resembled one was appealing to her.</p><p>Of course, Azrael was no fool. A lot of girls believed they would enjoy the company of a vampire &#x2013; if vampires existed. In reality, he knew they would cower or scream or run, or most likely all three. Still... he found himself hoping.</p><p>&#x201c;Sophie Bryce, right? The maid of honor?&#x201d; he asked, his smile utterly disarming. He&#x2019;d had millennia to practice.</p><p>Sophie blinked and he read her thoughts. She was desperately trying to find her head in the wake of his sudden presence. She&#x2019;d been torturing herself over the last few days, and he knew it. He&#x2019;d watched her every night. Listened to her. He knew damn well that she was drawn to him &#x2013; and that she hated herself for it.</p><p>He sensed it when a slight pain twinged up her arm and Sophie realized that her friend was holding her tight. Taylor&#x2019;s fingers curled into Sophie&#x2019;s forearm in utter distraction, her hazel eyes glued to Azrael. He knew she couldn&#x2019;t help it and wasn&#x2019;t aware of what she was doing, but the fact that she&#x2019;d brought his archess even the slightest discomfort was difficult for Az to ignore. It upset him.</p><p>And with practiced control, he tamped down the anger.</p><p>Sophie, on the other hand, appeared to be glad for the pain. It shot through the dazed fog that Az&#x2019;s appearance had caused. It also cleared her senses enough to allow her to pull her arm out of Taylor&#x2019;s grip, clear her throat, and say, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He tried not to smile when her voice cracked halfway through the single syllable. She cleared her throat some more and forced a smile to her lips. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; She was so fucking cute with half of her glorious golden locks tucked up underneath that Penguins cap. Wisps of it fell about her face, framing it and caressing it the way he wanted to.</p><p>He chuckled softly, watching her carefully to gauge the effect his laugh had on her. Sophie&#x2019;s gold eyes brightened, her lips parted, and her cheeks flushed ever so slightly. Az&#x2019;s monster reared its head and he felt his vision begin to heat up. If he wasn&#x2019;t careful, his eyes would begin to glow. &#x201c;We never got the chance to actually meet the other night,&#x201d; he told her, forcing himself to continue with the charade.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she agreed, relieved that she was finally finding her voice. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>He cocked his head to one side and slid his gaze from hers to regard her friends. He needed to look away &#x2013; just for a moment. Long enough to get himself under control once more. His gold eyes slowly scanned the faces of her companions &#x2013; and then stopped on the pair of men who sat behind them.</p><p>A quick scan of their minds told him they were recent graduates from Carnegie Mellon University. The one on the right was the son of a wealthy factory owner here in the city. His name was Richard. And he&#x2019;d been thinking all sorts of biblical things about Sophie that night.</p><p>Azrael grew very still and something dark flickered across his face. He knew it was there; he knew he was failing to hide his sudden fury. But he barely cared.</p><p>Richard fell back into the curve of his seat and swallowed hard as the blood drained from his face. Below him, Sophie cleared her throat, at once drawing Azrael&#x2019;s attention. Sophie slowly stood and turned to face him. &#x201c;Az, these are my friends, Taylor and Emily.&#x201d; She gestured toward them and they smiled nervously, but politely, nodding in his direction.</p><p>Emily and Taylor&#x2019;s eyes were still a little glazed over at his presence, so, Az allowed some of his vampiric influence to snake around and through the girls, easing them into a more comfortable state of relaxation.</p><p>It worked like a charm. Within seconds, Taylor was smiling easily and standing to greet him properly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you,&#x201d; she said, extending her hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Likewise,&#x201d; Az agreed, and with a slight bow, accepted the offered hands of both Taylor and then Emily, who quickly followed suit.</p><p>While he shook hands, Sophie&#x2019;s thoughts echoed through Az&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t believe that her friends weren&#x2019;t guessing he was the Masked One. It seemed so obvious to her now that she knew his secret. Everything about him screamed of the kind of rock star charisma that it took to hold millions of fans in sway.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sophie&#x2019;s gaze traveled over Azrael&#x2019;s form, and he tried not to visibly crow with the triumph he felt when she shamelessly took in the way the black button-up shirt under his sports coat stretched taut across the muscles of his chest. She was particularly fond of the curve of his neck where it met his shoulder.</p><p>Azrael released Emily&#x2019;s hand, straightened again, and heard Sophie&#x2019;s heart rate speed up.</p><p>He looked up to see that her sunshine eyes were glassy with unabashed desire. And, as if it would hide the way her mouth watered for him, she had pressed her bottom lip between two perfect, white teeth. Azrael&#x2019;s gaze locked on the plump lip. He quickly slipped his hands into the pockets of his trench coat as they tightened into fists at his sides, and his nails began to cut into his palms. He imagined her pressing hard enough with her teeth to draw blood.</p><p>If she did... it would all be over.</p><p>&#x201c;Juliette mentioned you live in Pittsburgh,&#x201d; he said, trying to break through not only his tension, but hers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d forgotten.&#x201d; His tone was gentle, personal. He knew that to her, it was as if they were the only two in the arena.</p><p>&#x201c;For now,&#x201d; she told him flat-out. She didn&#x2019;t want to bore him with the fact that she would only be there for two more days, but he was well aware.</p><p>&#x201c;But what are you doing here?&#x201d; she asked, honestly curious. It was quite a coincidence to her that she had never seen him before in her life &#x2013; and then, suddenly, she&#x2019;d seen him twice in the space of a week. She wasn&#x2019;t stupid; she was wary.</p><p>That was okay with him. He had a story and he would use it, but even this lie was too much of a secret for him to share with her friends.

An assignment to take the two-week makeover course at Deepdene and check it out as a possible documentary subject fails to thrill the practical Birdie, who arrives at the start of the rainy season. The staff, including glamorous owner Margot Bell and co-owner hairdresser Alistair Swanson, coddles Birdie and four other women as the unceasing rain threatens to flood the surrounding creek and turn the spa into an island. Soon spa secretary William Dean announces that Laurel Moon, who murdered his fiancee and five other women, has been released from the psychiatric institution to which she was committed. When Margot is killed in the same manner as Moon's victims, Birdie suspects the killer may be among the guests. She calls her friend, Det. Sgt. Toby, who arrives with Det. Constable Milson before the spa is shut off, but both men are quickly drugged out of commission, leaving Birdie, aided by another guest, to solve a series of murders with a nice bit of thinking. Happily the mildly eccentric, thoroughly modern Birdie isn't made over a bit. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.It's a dark and stormy night when Verity (``Birdie'') Birdwood (Death in Store), researching a TV project, arrives at Deepdene, a ritzy but recently money-troubled spa co-owned by the haughty, gorgeous Margot Bell and hairdresser extraordinaire Alistair. The next night, even darker and stormier, Margot is murdered in exactly the way serial-killer Laurel Moon dispatched her six victims--and Laurel has recently been paroled from prison. Could Laurel be one of the guests or staff members at Deepdene? Birdie phones pal Sergeant Toby for help, but upon arrival he and his constable are each slipped a mickey, the night grows still darker and stormier, and Birdie, naturally, picks up the investigation herself--but not before the manicurist is also killed. Eventually, Birdie will uncover several blackmail schemes, soured love affairs--and a prettier way to wear her hair. Birdie's less starchy and acerbic this time out, and the case has all the hallmarks of the Christie classic And Then There Were None--but, unfortunately, none of its breathtaking originality or vigor. A pleasant diversion, nonetheless, for cozy fans. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Every day, in the wee hours of morning, Mam leaves the two alone as she gathers other people&#x2019;s laundry to boil in a big metal copper at home. At night, if she&#x2019;s not too tired, Mam tells fanciful tales of dragons and ghosties, and on Sunday, she cautions the children about the O&#x2019;Rileys next door, who go to a church that is not for their kind. But on Christmas Eve, when Mam must go out, Bronwen and Dylan hear a ghostly plonk! plonk! plonk! from the washroom that sends them running straight into the arms of Mrs. O&#x2019;Riley. Not only do they find that the house next door harbors nothing to fear, but it may hold a blessing for Mam, too. With evocative drawings full of compelling detail, Shirley Hughes tells a timeless, genuine tale of community and human kindness.</p><p><b>Shirley Hughes&nbsp;</b>is the illustrator of more than two hundred children&#x2019;s books and has won many prestigious awards, including the Kate Greenaway Medal twice. She is the author-illustrator of&nbsp;<i>Olly and Me 1 2 3&nbsp;</i>with Candlewick. She lives in London.Hughes goes back to her own childhood in Liverpool for this thoughtful story. Bronwen and her brother, Dylan, live with their widowed mother, who takes in laundry to make ends meet. They keep to themselves, especially avoiding the O&#x2019;Riley neighbors, who go to a different church. But one Christmas Eve, Mam goes out, leaving the children alone. It&#x2019;s fine at first, but then a &#x201c;Plonk! Plonk!&#x201d; sound comes from the attached washhouse. Frightened, the children run outside, into the arms of Mrs. O&#x2019;Riley, who shows them the sound is only her sons playing darts. When Mam returns and realizes what a fine neighbor she has, Christmas is a little sweeter. Some of the intended audience may be puzzled by the &#x201c;different church&#x201d; problem, so subtly is it worked into the story. But the general meme about setting aside prejudices will be clear. Here, though, it&#x2019;s the details of an impoverished childhood, illustrated in Hughes&#x2019; signature style, that will have the most effect. This is a world of hard labor and small treats, where kindness goes a long way.

Lewis Signature Classics range. C.S. Lewis&#39;s dazzling allegory about heaven and hell and the chasm fixed between them, is one of his most brilliantly imaginative tales which will appeal to readers of all ages. Lewis communicates deep spiritual truths through the sheer power of the fantastic. In The Great Divorce the writer in a dream boards a bus on a drizzly afternoon and embarks on an incredible voyage through Heaven and Hell. He meets a host of supernatural beings far removed from his expectations and comes to significant realisations about the ultimate consequences of everyday behaviour. This is the starting point for a profound meditation upon good and evil. &#34;If we insist on keeping Hell (or even Earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.&#34;</p><p><i>The Great Divorce</i> is C.S. Lewis's <i>Divine Comedy</i>: the narrator bears strong resemblance to Lewis (by way of Dante); his Virgil is the fantasy writer George MacDonald; and upon boarding a bus in a nondescript neighborhood, the narrator is taken to Heaven and Hell. The book's primary message is presented with almost oblique tidiness--"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, '<i>Thy</i> will be done.'" However, the narrator's descriptions of sin and temptation will hit quite close to home for many readers. Lewis has a genius for describing the intricacies of vanity and self-deception, and this book is tremendously persistent in forcing its reader to consider the ultimate consequences of everyday pettiness. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>C. S. Lewis again employs his formidable talent for fable and allegory. The writer, in a dream, finds himself in a bus which travels between Hell and Heaven. This is the starting point for an extraordinary meditation upon good and evil. In Lewis&#x2019;s own words, &#x201c;If we insist on keeping Hell (or even earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.&#x201d;</p><h2>Goosebumps #46: How to Kill a Monster</h2><p>They&#39;re baa-ck!

By the onset of World War II in 1939, Germany, Italy and Russia were already advanced in their development of paratrooper units. Germany in particular demonstrated the tactical shock of paratroopers in Western Europe in 1940 and, most spectacularly, in Crete in 1941, galvanizing the UK and the United States to expand and train their own airborne forces, which they unleashed in 1943&#x2013;45. The Allied paratrooper drops on D-Day (6 June 1944) and those of Operation Market Garden (17&#x2013;25 September 1944) were the stuff of legend, huge in scale and ambition, but both Allied and Axis paratroopers were deployed in numerous other actions, including special forces raids.<br><br>It quickly became apparent that the physical and tactical demands placed upon paratroopers required men of exceptional stamina, courage and intelligence. To create these soldiers, levels of training were unusually punishing and protracted, and those who came through to take their &#x2018;wings&#x2019; were a true elite.<br><br>Casemate&#x2019;s The Paratrooper Training Pocket Manual 1939&#x2013;1945 provides an unusually detailed insight into what it took to make a military paratrooper, and how he was then utilized in actions where expected survival might be measured in a matter of days. Using archive material from British, US, German and other primary sources, many never before published, the book explains paratrooper theory, training, and practice in detail. The content includes: details of the physical training, instruction in static-line parachute deployment, handling the various types of parachutes and harnesses, landing on dangerous terrain, small-arms handling, airborne deployment of heavier combat equipment, landing in hostile drop zones, tactics in the first minutes of landing, radio comms, and much more.<br><br>Featuring original manual diagrams and illustrations, plus new introductory text explaining the history and context of airborne warfare, The Paratrooper Training Pocket Manual 1939&#x2013;1945 provides a detailed insight into the principles and practice of this unique type of combat soldier.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction<br><br>Chapter 1 Recruitment and Physical Training<br>Chapter 2 Paratrooper Weapons and Equipment<br>Chapter 3 Parachute and Glider Training<br>Chapter 4 Drop Zone &#x2013; Deployment and Tactics<br>Chapter 5 Achieving the Objective &#x2013; Defensive and Offensive Tactics<br><br>Further Reading</p><p>Chris McNab is a writer and editor specialising in military history, with a major research interest in the evolution of modern manoeuvre warfare.

LOUIS POST-DISPATCH</i></b><br><br>As the 1960s drew to a close, the United States was coming apart at the seams. From August 1969 to August 1970, the nation witnessed nine thousand protests and eighty-four acts of arson or bombings at schools across the country. It was the year of the My Lai massacre investigation, the Cambodia invasion, Woodstock, and the Moratorium to End the War. The American death toll in Vietnam was approaching fifty thousand, and the ascendant counterculture was challenging nearly every aspect of American society. <i>Witness to the Revolution</i>, Clara Bingham&#x2019;s unique oral history of that tumultuous time, unveils anew that moment when America careened to the brink of a civil war at home, as it fought a long, futile war abroad.<br><br> Woven together from one hundred original interviews, <i>Witness to the Revolution </i>provides a firsthand narrative of that period of upheaval in the words of those closest to the action&#x2014;the activists, organizers, radicals, and resisters who manned the barricades of what Students for a Democratic Society leader Tom Hayden called &#x201c;the Great Refusal.&#x201d;<br><br> We meet Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground; Daniel Ellsberg, the former Defense Department employee who released the Pentagon Papers; feminist theorist Robin Morgan; actor and activist Jane Fonda; and many others whose powerful personal stories capture the essence of an era. We witness how the killing of four students at Kent State turned a straitlaced social worker into a hippie, how the civil rights movement gave birth to the women&#x2019;s movement, and how opposition to the war in Vietnam turned college students into prisoners, veterans into peace marchers, and intellectuals into bombers.<br><br> With lessons that can be applied to our time, <i>Witness to the Revolution</i> is more than just a record of the death throes of the Age of Aquarius. Today, when America is once again enmeshed in racial turmoil, extended wars overseas, and distrust of the government, the insights contained in this book are more relevant than ever.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Witness to the Revolution</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Especially for younger generations who didn&#x2019;t live through it,&nbsp;<i>Witness to the Revolution</i>&nbsp;is a valuable and entertaining primer on a moment in American history the likes of which we may never see again.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Bryan Burrough,&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A rich tapestry of a volatile period in American history.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Time</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A gripping oral history of the centrifugal social forces tearing America apart at the end of the &#x2019;60s . . .

In August 1964, Congress authorized the use of troops in Vietnam in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident&#x2014;�the alleged North Vietnamese attack on a U.S. naval ship. That same month, civil rights workers put their lives on the line for voter registration in the Mississippi Summer Project. Seven months later, on Sunday, March 7, 1965, John Lewis and six hundred protesters were filmed being beaten as they walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, at the start of their march to Montgomery for voting rights; the images of the attack on a nonviolent protest vividly dramatized the stakes of the struggle. Just one day after Bloody Sunday, the first U.S. combat troops landed in Vietnam. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how President Johnson can send troops to Vietnam and can&#x2019;t send troops to Selma, Alabama,&#x201d; John Lewis, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), remarked. The military draft followed soon after, ultimately calling 2.2 million men to fight in Vietnam. Skills learned on the battleground for racial equality in the South&#x2014;�mass civil disobedience and grassroots organization&#x2014;�were soon employed in the new campaign against the war in Vietnam. In reaction to the disproportionate number of black soldiers being killed in Vietnam, SNCC activists organized one of the first anti-�draft demonstrations, at the Atlanta induction center in 1966, and coined the slogan &#x201c;Hell no, we won&#x2019;t go!&#x201d; The war over there was soon to become a war over here.<br><br>David Harris (Stanford student, draft resistance organizer)<br><br>I came from Fresno, California, where I was Fresno High School &#x201c;Boy of the Year&#x201d; in 1963. Several weeks after I got to Stanford, there was a meeting about volunteers going to Mississippi. This was the first time that the black students in Mississippi had issued an invitation to white students to come down, and they invited students from Stanford and Yale. In the fall of &#x2019;64, I started classes and was meeting my girlfriend for dinner and she said, &#x201c;I was at a meeting. There&#x2019;s a car going down to Mississippi tomorrow.&#x201d; They were running a parallel election in Mississippi called the Freedom Vote, to show what would happen if black people were allowed to vote, and they needed volunteers, so I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d; I told my brother to call my parents after I was gone, and I got a seat in the car and left that night.<br><br>Two days later, we were in Mississippi. I was worried about missing the great adventure of my time. You didn&#x2019;t have to have an ideology or politics to go to Mississippi in those days. You just had to have values.<br><br>That summer of &#x2019;64 we had all been watching what was going on in Mississippi, so it was a no-�brainer for me. Campaigning for the right of black people not to be lynched for trying to vote was a pretty easy call. So I went. I was eighteen years old.<br><br>Wesley Brown (Black Panther, draft resister)<br><br>My family moved to East Elmhurst, right near LaGuardia Airport, in 1952. It was formerly an Italian neighborhood, but as more blacks moved in, of course, the whites made their departure. By 1955 it was nearly an all-�black neighborhood. These were working-�class blacks trying to move up. They saved their money like my parents, and bought a home, and tried to enter the lower middle class. My father was a machinist at a tool and die factory in the Bronx, where he worked for about forty years. Queens at that time was called God&#x2019;s country. If you could get out of the projects and buy a house in Queens, you were on your way. It was a very solid, tight-�knit community where parents wanted to make a better life for their kids. In fact, Eric Holder, President Obama&#x2019;s first attorney general, lived on our block. My sister used to babysit him and his younger brother, Billy. So it was that kind of neighborhood. Everyone was trying to do the right thing, be responsible, and trying to make a way for themselves and their families. And of course, that leads to a certain amount of conservatism, a wish not to stir things up.<br><br>These were black folks who knew their history, because they were only the second generation born after emancipation. My father&#x2019;s grandmother was born into slavery and he knew her. She would show him her thumb, which was all splayed out and deformed, because when she did something that the overseer didn&#x2019;t like, he would take a razor blade and split her thumb open, and it would never heal sufficiently before he would open it up again. My father was born in North Carolina and was the tenth of twelve children. These black folks knew what this country had been through with slavery and segregation and they weren&#x2019;t prepared for their children being boisterous and assertive in a way that they couldn&#x2019;t afford to be.<br><br>David Harris<br><br>Four of us were working together in a team trying to register people for the Freedom Vote, in the black part of a town called Lambert. After working all morning, we came back to where the car was parked, and the three guys wanted to go to the post office to mail some letters and I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay here by the car.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m standing by our car, and up pulls a pickup truck with two white guys in it. They get out. One&#x2019;s got a shotgun; the other one&#x2019;s got a pistol. The guy with the shotgun sticks it right up against my nose and says, &#x201c;Nigger lover, I&#x2019;m giving you five minutes to get out of town before I blow your head off.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m an eighteen-�year-�old Stanford student. &#x201c;Well, what do you mean? Who are you?&#x201d; And he just says, &#x201c;Nigger, I said five minutes.&#x201d; At that point, the other three guys came back, took one look at the situation, and we all jumped in the car and left Lambert, Mississippi.<br><br>Wesley Brown<br><br>I remember vividly the photographs in Jet magazine of Emmett Till in his casket in 1955. His mother wanted an open casket so people could see what was done to him&#x2014;�his misshapen face that was bludgeoned into nonrecognition. And I remember watching those kids in Little Rock in &#x2019;57 trying to go to Central High and Eisenhower finally getting the National Guard to come in, so that they could go to school without being killed. The memory of those images and the virulent hatred directed at those kids was indelible for me. And of course, there were the Freedom Rides, the lunch counter sit-�ins by those students from Shaw University in North Carolina, and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. We got our first television in 1949, so all of these images were a part of my coming of age.<br><br>David Harris<br><br>Everything that followed grew out of the Mississippi taproot. We learned how to organize by working with SNCC in Mississippi, and perhaps much more important was the spirit of Mississippi; there was a kind of inspiration in the heroism of the black people in Mississippi. It&#x2019;s really hard to recapture what that was like. For example, we were working in Quitman County; the county seat is called Marks. There was a seventy-�five-�year-�old black woman there who walked into the registrar of voters office and said, &#x201c;I want to register to vote.&#x201d; They arrested her, threw her in jail, tortured her with an electric cattle prod, and then released her from jail. She walked out of jail and down the street to the registrar of voters office and said, &#x201c;I want to register to vote.&#x201d; These are people whose names are lost to history, but when you have that kind of encounter, somehow you get a whole new perspective on what&#x2019;s of value and how to behave in the face of oppression, and the strength that any single person or a group of people can bring with their own will.<br><br>The third thing that came out of Mississippi was the experience of seeing America from a different perspective. You see what was being done to black people for simply trying to exercise the rights that we supposedly won with hard-�fought battles a hundred years ago. And to see not only that that was going on, but how the rest of the country had turned a blind eye to it and talked bullshit about the southern way of life, and courtly manners. Isn&#x2019;t it sweet? These were mean, vicious, narrow-�minded people, who were standing on the backs of people who were helpless to fight back. And everybody in America let that happen. So suddenly, you come back from that, and you can&#x2019;t look at it the same way. It was precisely that perspective that brought the Vietnam War into focus.<br><br>Wesley Brown<br><br>So I was at SUNY Oswego in January 1965, on Lake Ontario, in central New York, and some SNCC workers came to speak. I was already feeling that I wanted to be a part of something that was going on that I felt would make a difference. I was about twenty years old at that point. Their visit changed my life in many ways, and I decided to go to Mississippi.<br><br>My parents couldn&#x2019;t believe that I would put myself in harm&#x2019;s way, given what had happened in Mississippi the year before. They left the South in the thirties, as many blacks did, because of the Depression, to find work in the North as part of the Great Migration. They couldn&#x2019;t believe that I would return to a place that they left.<br><br>I remember taking a Port Authority bus in June of 1965 to Memphis, about a twenty-�eight-�hour bus ride, and then having to get another bus to Holly Springs, Mississippi. So that began the four months I spent in northern Mississippi, right near the Tennessee border, working on voter registration.<br><br>David Harris<br><br>Right after I got back from Mississippi came the first major escalations of the Vietnam War, when all of a sudden we went from advisor status to deploying full combat units there, and the rise to six hundred thousand troops began. I marched in my first antiwar march about six months after I got back from Mississippi.<br><br>My father was an officer in the Army Reserve for twenty years. My brother ended up a captain in the Eighty-�second Airborne Division. I&#x2019;ve had ancestors in every war starting with the revolution. Like all my generation, I assumed that we would have a war to fight. We grew up watching Victory at Sea on television. But when the war that they had for us came, it was obvious this wasn&#x2019;t what I thought I would be doing. This wasn&#x2019;t about freedom or democracy or wearing white hats or helping people. This was essentially keeping a bunch of scumbags in power and prolonging the French Empire. Coming back from Mississippi, I could believe it.<br><br>Wesley Brown<br><br>A few days after my arrival, I was sent to Jackson, Mississippi, for a demonstration with the intent of filling up the jails. Within minutes of getting out of the car in Jackson, I was arrested, and thrown into a field house with hundreds of protesters, because the city jails were full. Before bail was set, the lawyers were interviewing people, and they asked me, &#x201c;Do you want us to get in touch with your family to let them know where you are?&#x201d; It was Father&#x2019;s Day, and this lawyer talked to my father, and wished him happy Father&#x2019;s Day for me. After I got out a week later, I contacted my parents and I let them know that I was okay. It was a very emotional and not a happy time for them.<br><br>Like any parents, my father and mother did not want their children to have to go through the things they had gone through when they lived in the South. They shared my beliefs but didn&#x2019;t want me to have to deal with the consequences of my beliefs. My father used to say, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get up in the face of the powers that be. You have to find a way to work around the system, but if you make too much noise and draw attention to yourself, you&#x2019;re just setting yourself up for a fall.&#x201d; <br><br>David Harris<br><br>I considered myself part of the movement from the day I left for Mississippi. What we call &#x201c;The Movement,&#x201d; capital T, capital M, was a commitment to justice and the values of democracy. They called us the New Left because it wasn&#x2019;t an ideology. There wasn&#x2019;t a specific politics attached to it. What it was, was a set of values finding ways to express themselves.<br><br>I was in marches, I was in rallies and demonstrations. But there was always the larger question of the conscription system. In that era, when any male turned eighteen, he had to go to the post office and register for the Selective Service System. When you registered for Selective Service, they gave you two cards. One was proof that you had registered, and the other indicated your classification. Because under the Selective Service, there were various classifications, starting from 1-�A, which meant you were cannon fodder, to you were going to get a notice soon in the mail saying &#x201c;Report to 4-�F,&#x201d; which meant you were physically unable to perform and therefore exempt. In between that, the largest one was 2-�S, which was the student deferment. Anybody in college making, quote, &#x201c;reasonable progress towards a degree&#x201d; had a temporary exemption until they finished their education. So that was the system that covered all of our lives&#x2014;�all of the male lives, anyway.<br><br>Always there was floating out there, what happens when they call your number? We&#x2014;�understandably&#x2014;�focused on that a lot. I mean there were people going to graduate school so that they wouldn&#x2019;t get drafted. There were people getting married so they wouldn&#x2019;t get drafted, because early on, being married was an exemption. They weren&#x2019;t going to draft family men. They thought if I want to take a year off and just go to Paris and write poetry, you&#x2019;re headed for the tall grass if you do that. This defined everybody&#x2019;s life.<br><br>Wesley Brown<br><br>After I left Mississippi and returned to college, I went to the school registrar with a friend and we asked that our student deferment classifications not be sent to the Selective Service, because we felt that it discriminated against blacks who didn&#x2019;t have the opportunity to go to college. The registrar went ballistic but honored my request, and my classification was changed to 1-�A, which meant I was subject to be drafted. But because I had been arrested in Mississippi, my classification was changed to 1-�Y, which meant that if you had an outstanding legal charge against you, you wouldn&#x2019;t be among the first who would be called.</p><h2>An Empty Coast</h2><p>Sonja Kurtz&#x2014;former soldier, supposedly retired mercenary&#x2014;is in Vietnam carrying out a personal revenge mission when her daughter sends a call for help.

The Prime Meridian passes near a surprising number of landmarks that loom large in science: Isaac Newton's chambers at Trinity College, Cambridge; Charles Darwin's home at Down, in Kent; the site where the first dinosaur fossils were discovered; and John Harrison's clocks in a museum room of the Royal Observatory, among many others. Visiting them in turn, Raymo brings to life the human dramas of courageous individuals who bucked reigning orthodoxies to expand our horizons, including one brave rebel who paid the ultimate price for surmising the multitude of worlds we now take for granted.</p><p>A splendid short history of astronomy and geology, <i>Walking Zero</i> illuminates the startling interplay of science, psychology, faith, and the arts in our understanding of space and time.</p></p><p><p>For nearly forty years, Chet Raymo has been exploring the relationship between science, nature, and the humanities as a professor, writer, illustrator and naturalist. A professor emeritus of astronomy and physics at Stonehill College in North Easton, Massachusetts, He is the author of more than eight books on science, including the highly-praised <i>An Intimate Look at the Night Sky</i>, <i>365 Starry Nights</i>, <i>The Soul of the Night</i>, <i>Honey from Stone</i>, and <i>Skeptics and True Believers</i>. Since 1985, he has written "Science Musings" for the <i>Boston Globe,</i> a weekly science and nature column reflecting upon the human side of science. Chet Raymo and his wife Maureen live in North Easton, Massachusetts.</p>The latest from noted science writer Raymo (<i>An Intimate Look at the Night Sky</i>) isn't merely a history of the prime meridian, the zero-longitude line passing through eastern England that is the starting point for measuring both space and time on Earth. Roughly speaking, Raymo is interested in how we understand our place in the cosmos, and his walk along the prime meridian is a meditation on the evolving ways that humans have measured and understood space and time, stopping here and there at some of the most prominent landmarks in the history of science. The slender volume covers an astonishing amount of ground, ranging from the astronomers of ancient Alexandria to the fellows of the British Royal Society, from Piltdown Man to contemporary debates over relativism and scientific knowledge. The result is an unexpected combination of popular history, travelogue and intellectual memoir, as meandering and invigorating as a brisk country walk, and while there is little here that hasn't been recounted elsewhere, the real joy is in the journey&#x2014;one could hardly ask for a better travel companion than Raymo, a professor emeritus of physics and astronomy whose prose is delightfully erudite and introspective. 25 b&amp;w illus., 1 map. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It will be one of the biggest movies of 2002, opening in the USA in January, followed by world-wide release. A big UK opening is now tentatively set for early March. For thirteen months the entire town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic &#34;Bird&#34; - the Mothman.</p><p><p>JOHN A.

It was 3 A.M. on a cold, wet morning in late November 1967, and the little houses scattered along the dirt road winding through the hills of West Virginia were all dark. Some seemed unoccupied and in the final stages of decay. Others were un-painted, neglected, forlorn. The whole setting was like the opening scene of a Grade B horror film from the 1930s.<br>Along the road there came a stranger in a land where strangers were rare and suspect. He walked up to the door of a crumbling farmhouse and hammered. After a long moment a light blinked on somewhere in the house and a young woman appeared, drawing a cheap mail-order bathrobe tightly about her. She opened the door a crack and her sleep-swollen face winced with fear as she stared at the apparition on her doorstep. He was over six feet tall and dressed entirely in black. He wore a black suit, black tie, black hat, and black overcoat, with impractical black dress shoes covered with mud. His face, barely visible in the darkness, sported a neatly trimmed mustache and goatee. The flashes of lightning behind him added an eerie effect.<br>"May I use your phone?" He asked in a deep baritone, his voice lacking the familiar West Virginia accent. The girl gulped silently and backed away.<br>"My husband..." She mumbled. 'Talk to my husband."<br>She closed the door quickly and backed away into the darkness. Minutes passed. Then she returned accompanied by a rugged young man hastily buckling his trousers in place. He, too, turned pale at the sight of the stranger.<br>"We ain't got a phone here," he grunted through the crack in the door just before he slammed it. The couple retreated murmuring to themselves and the tall stranger faded into the night.<br>Beards were a very rare sight in West Virginia in 1967. Men in formal suits and ties were even rarer in those back hills of the Ohio valley. And bearded, black-garbed strangers on foot in the rain had never been seen there before.<br>In the days that followed the young couple told their friends about the apparition. Obviously, they concluded, he had been a fearful omen of some sort. Perhaps he had been the devil himself!<br>Three weeks later these two people were dead, among the victims of the worst tragedy ever to strike that section of West Virginia. They were driving across the Silver Bridge, which spanned the Ohio River, when it suddenly collapsed.<br>Their friends remembered. They remembered the story of the bearded stranger in the night. It had, indeed, been a sinister omen. One that confirmed their religious beliefs and superstitions. So a new legend was born. Beelzebub had visited West Virginia on the eve of a terrible tragedy.</p><h2>The Boat of a Million Years</h2><p>1st edition 1st printing paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>The bestselling author of such classic novels as <i>Brain Wave</i> and <i>The Boat of a Million Years</i>, Poul Anderson won just about every award the science fiction and fantasy field has to offer.

Pytheas looked sharply at him. Against the plain, whitewashed room where they sat, the Phoenician seemed vivid, like a flash of sunlight from outside. It might only be due to the brightness of eyes and teeth or a skin tan even in winter. Otherwise he was ordinary, slender and supple but of medium height, features aquiline, hair and neatly trimmed beard a crow&#x2019;s-wing black. He wore an unadorned tunic, scuffed sandals, a single gold finger ring.<br>&#x201c;You cannot mean that,&#x201c; said the Greek.<br>Hanno came out of reverie, shook himself, laughed. &#x201c;Oh, no. A trope, of course. Though it would be well to make sure beforehand that enough of your men do believe we live on a sphere. They&#x2019;ll have ample terrors and troubles without fearing a plunge off the edge into some abyss.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You sound educated,&#x201c; said Pytheas slowly.<br>&#x201c;Should I not? I have traveled, but also studied. And you, sir, a learned man, a philosopher, propose to voyage into the sheerly unknown. You actually hope to come back.&#x201d; Hanno picked a goblet off the small table between them and sipped of the tempered wine that a slave had brought.<br>Pytheas shifted on his stool. A charcoal brazier had made the room close as well as warm. His lungs longed for a breath of clean air. &#x201c;Not altogether unknown,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;Your people go that far. Lykias told me you claim to have been there yourself.&#x201d;<br>Hanno sobered. &#x201c;I told him the truth. I&#x2019;ve journeyed that way more than once, both overland and by sea. But so much of it is wilderness, so much else is changing these days, in ways unforeseeable but usually violent. And the Carthaginians are interested just in the tin, with whatever other things they can pick up incidental to that. They only touch on the southern end of the Pretanic Isles. The rest is outside their ken, or any civilized man&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And yet you desire to come with me.&#x201d;<br>Hanno in his turn studied his host before replying. Pytheas too was simply clad. He was tall for a Greek, lean, features sharp beneath a high forehead, clean-shaven, with a few deep lines. Curly brown hair showed frost at the temples. His eyes were gray. The directness of their glance bespoke imperiousness, or innocence, or perhaps both.<br>&#x201c;I think I do,&#x201c; said Hanno carefully. &#x201c;We shall have to talk further. However, in my fashion, like you in yours, I want to learn as much as I can about this earth and its peoples while I am still above it. When your man Lykias went about the city inquiring after possible advisors, and I heard, I was happy to seek him out.&#x201d; Again he grinned. &#x201c;Also, I am in present need of employment. There ought to be a goodly profit in this.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We are not going as traders,&#x201c; Pytheas explained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have wares along, but to exchange for what we need rather than to get wealthy. We are, though, pledged excellent pay on our return.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I gather the city is not sponsoring the venture?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Correct. A consortium of merchants is. They want to know the chances and costs of a sea route to the far North, now that the Gauls are making the land dangerous. Not tin alone, you understand--tin may be the least of it--but amber, furs, slaves, whatever those countries offer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Gauls indeed.&#x201d; Nothing else need be said. They had poured over the mountains to make the nearer part of Italy theirs; a long lifetime ago war chariots rumbled, swords flashed, homes blazed, wolves and ravens feasted across Europe. Hanno did add: &#x201c;I have some acquaintance with them. That should help. Be warned, the prospects of such a route are poor. Besides them, the Carthaginians.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>Hanno cocked his head. &#x201c;Nevertheless, you are organizing this expedition.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To follow knowledge,&#x201c; Pytheas answered quietly. &#x201c;I am fortunate in that two of the sponsors are...more intelligent than most. They value understanding for its own sake.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Knowledge has a trick of paying off in unexpected ways.&#x201d; Hanno smiled. &#x201c;Forgive me. I&#x2019;m a crass Phoenician. You&#x2019;re a man of consequence in public affairs--inherited money, I&#x2019;ve heard--but first and foremost a philosopher. You need a navigator at sea, a guide and interpreter ashore. I believe I am the one for you.&#x201d;<br>Pytheas&#x2019; tone sharpened. &#x201c;What are you doing in Massalia? Why are you prepared to aid something that is...not in the interests of Carthage?&#x201d;<br>Hanno turned serious. &#x201c;I am no traitor, for I am not a Carthaginian. True, I&#x2019;ve lived in the city, among many different places. But I&#x2019;m not overly fond of it. They&#x2019;re too puritanical there, too little touched by any grace of Greece or Persia; and their human sacrifices--&#x201d; He grimaced, then shrugged. &#x201c;To sit in judgment on what people do is a fool&#x2019;s game. They&#x2019;ll continue doing it regardless. As for me, I&#x2019;m from Old Phoenicia, the East. Alexandros destroyed Tyre, and the civil wars after his death have left that part of the world in sorry shape. I seek my fortune where I can. I&#x2019;m a wanderer by nature anyway.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I shall have to get better acquainted with you,&#x201c; Pytheas said, blunter than he was wont. Did he already feel at ease with this stranger?<br>&#x201c;Certainly.&#x201d; Again Hanno&#x2019;s manner grew cheerful. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought how to prove my skills to you. In a short time. You realize the need to embark soon, don&#x2019;t you? Preferably at the start of sailing season.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because of Carthage?&#x201d;<br>Hanno nodded. &#x201c;This new war in Sicily will engage her whole attention for a while. Agathokles of Syracuse is a harder enemy than the Carthaginian suffetes have taken the trouble to discover. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if he carries the fight to their shores.&#x201d;<br>Pytheas stared. &#x201c;How can you be so sure?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was lately there, and I&#x2019;ve learned to pay attention. In Carthage too. You&#x2019;re aware she discourages all foreign traffic beyond the Pillars of Herakles--often by methods that would be called piracy were it the work of a private party. Well, the suffetes now speak of an out-and-out blockade. If they win this war, or at least fight it to a draw, I suspect they&#x2019;ll lack the resources for some time afterward; but eventually they&#x2019;ll do it. Your expedition will take a pair of years at least, likelier three, very possibly more. The earlier you set forth, the earlier you&#x2019;ll come home--if you do--and not run into a Carthaginian patrol. What a shame, after an odyssey like that, to end at the bottom of the sea or on an auction block.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have an escort of warships.&#x201d;<br>Hanno shook his head. &#x201c;Oh, no. Anything less than a penteconter would be useless, and that long hull would never survive the North Atlantic. My friend, you haven&#x2019;t seen waves or storms till you&#x2019;ve been younder. Also, how do you carry food and water for all those rowers? They burn it like wildfire, you know, and resupplying will be chancy at best.

Pytheas escorted his visitor out. They stopped for a moment at the front door.<br>The house stood high on a ridge above the bay. Eastward, beyond city walls, hills glowed with sunset. The streets of the old Greek colony had become rivers of shadow. Voices, footfalls, wheels were muted; the air rested in chilly peace. Westward the sun cast a bridge across the waters. Masts in the harbor stood stark against it. Gulls cruising overhead caught the light on their wings, gold beneath blue.<br>&#x201c;A lovely sight,&#x201c; Pytheas said low. &#x201c;This coast must be the most beautiful in the world.&#x201d;<br>Hanno parted his lips as if to tell about others he had seen, closed them, said finally: &#x201c;Let us try to bring you back here, then.

Now she takes readers on another rollicking ride across the Mississippi cotton fields and into the glamour of New Orleans...as P.I. Sarah Booth Delaney follows a winding trail of murder and deception into a world where ghosts make fashion statements&#x2014;and where one person&#x2019;s miracle is another person&#x2019;s mayhem.<br><br>The leaves of the calendar may be shedding faster than the sycamores on her family&#x2019;s decaying Mississippi plantation, but thirty-something southern belle Sarah Booth Delaney isn&#x2019;t ready to sing the blues. Not when she&#x2019;s got a thriving detective agency and the outspoken, outrageously attired ghost of her great-great-grandmother&#x2019;s nanny to keep her on her toes. But the matchmaking phantom may have the last word on motherhood when Sarah Booth takes on the controversial case of an accused baby killer.<br><br>Although Doreen Mallory&#x2019;s been arrested for feeding sleeping pills to her ten-week-old daughter, no one could accuse her of lacking faith. A healer who, tragically, couldn&#x2019;t save her own baby girl, born with multiple birth defects, Doreen has her own crosses to bear. While the local law seems convinced of Doreen&#x2019;s guilt, Sarah Booth isn&#x2019;t so sure. But why is Doreen reluctant to talk about the men in her life? Like the televangelist who stands to lose a lot more than his flock. Or the married politician with family ties to the Mob. Either of them could be little Rebekah&#x2019;s father; either of them could also be her killer.<br><br>With Halloween approaching and her own personal life up for grabs, Sarah Booth could use a little faith healing herself. Torn between a married sheriff and an old flame who&#x2019;s literally sweeping her off her feet, she&#x2019;d better be prepared for the fallout of her most <br>unpopular case yet. Justice may not stand a ghost of a chance as a decades-old secret explodes, unleashing a storm of fury on Sarah Booth and all those she loves.<br><br>Witty, suspenseful, and featuring a cast of memorable characters, Hallowed Bones is a riveting tale of faith, murder, and maternal love. It is Carolyn Haines&#x2019;s most accomplished novel yet.</p><p>A native of Mississippi, Carolyn Haines lives in southern Alabama on a farm with her husband, horses, dogs, and cats. She has been honored with an Alabama State Council on the Arts literary fellowship for her writing, a family with enough idiosyncracies to give her material for the rest of her life, and a bevy of terrific friends. She is a former photojournalist.?1<br>When the brisk winds of October skim over the drying bolls of cotton, I find myself caught in the web of time. In the rustle of the cotton leaves, in the clear light of autumn, and the grape smell of blooming kudzu, the past lurks like a siren, promising the pleasure of memory and delivering the pain of regret.<br><br>Sitting on the front porch at Dahlia House, sipping a third cup of coffee, I watch the sycamore leaves drift into the driveway. Dahlia House needs a coat of paint. I need so much more than that.<br><br>The leaves of the calendar seem to be shedding faster than the sycamores, and I'm caught in limbo. I went to bed last night thinking about Sheriff Coleman Peters and his pregnant wife, and I awoke this morning remembering the feel of Scott Hampton beside me. I sat up in bed, knowing that I let Scott walk away without a single word that might have encouraged him to stay. One word. Please. It might have been enough.<br><br>That I couldn't ask him to stay while I sorted through the secrets of my heart doesn't make it any easier to wake up alone, remembering a man's touch. October arouses terrible longings. The Delaney womb is sending a series of demanding and not-so-subtle messages.<br><br>"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were havin' a case of the low-down and dirties." The familiar voice came from behind me. "The blues, unless you're singin' 'em, are a total waste of time, Sarah Booth Delaney."<br><br>I sniffed the air, catching the tantalizing scent of a cigarette. I hadn't smoked in three years, but the craving was on me in a flash. Glancing over my shoulder, I was amazed to see Jitty, a circa 1850's ghost, reclining in a rocking chair, with one leg draped over the arm. A lazy drift of smoke curled from a cigarette holder in her right hand.<br><br>"What are you doing?" I was astounded at the cigarette and her outfit. Her dress was a short, tight tube of glittery mauve material layered with black fringe. A matching band of material circled her head, allowing some artfully arranged curls to escape. Clunky shoes with high heels were strapped across her feet, leading up to stockings with a seam.<br><br>"Close your mouth," she advised, clamping the cigarette holder between her teeth. "I ain't smokin', I'm just stylin'."<br><br>"What would it hurt if you were? You're a ghost," I pointed out. "You can smoke without any ill effects."<br><br>"Smoke won't kill you nearly as quickly as regrets," Jitty said matter-of-factly.<br><br>"What are you doing in that getup?" I asked, indicating her dress. "It's nine o'clock in the morning." Jitty, as the resident haint of Dahlia House, punched no mortal time clocks. She was on the job twenty-four/seven. "Not even ghosts have costume balls in the morning, and you're about a week early for Halloween."<br><br>"You are in a mood," she said. "Scott Hampton wasn't the man for you, Sarah Booth. He'da made one fine sperm donor, but he wasn't built for the long haul. Quit kickin' yourself and focus on the positive."<br><br>"Like what?" I asked, and then instantly regretted it. Asking Jitty such a question was a bit like inviting a vampire into your house.<br><br>"Do you know when women got the right to vote?" she asked.<br><br>I sighed. "No, I don't. And I don't care. My own personal history is troublesome enough without taking on the world. I know everything there is to know about me, and I still can't fix my life. Knowing all that history won't help anyone. It just makes a person run around in strange outfits."<br><br>"It was 1920. Up until your mother's generation, women couldn't even establish credit in their own name. Back then, a woman didn't have a man, she didn't stand a chance of survivin'. Leastways nowadays you can be an old maid and still keep your property."<br><br>I looked at my black coffee and wished for a good dollop of Jameson in it. To that end I got up and went inside. Instead of going to the parlor where the bar was, at the last minute I turned left and headed for my new office. I'd been up since five arranging the two new desks, two new chairs, filing cabinets, telephones, fax machine, and other office paraphernalia. I'd had a busy and productive morning. Until I'd started thinking about Scott.<br><br>Jitty followed me, lecturing as she went, but I wasn't about to encourage her by answering. The past haunted both of us, and I saw no good end in indulging in it.<br><br>The room I'd selected as the official digs for Delaney Detective Agency was a master bedroom suite in the east wing of the house. It was perfect because it had its own entrance and a small sitting room that would serve perfectly for a receptionist, should that day ever arrive when we could afford one. I'd kept the entire project a secret from Tinkie, but I was expecting her at any minute so I could spring the surprise. Her desk even had a nameplate. And the frosted glass exterior door said Delaney Detective Agency. The next lines were Delaney and Richmond, Private Investigators.<br><br>"What do you think, Jitty?" I couldn't resist asking her, though she had grave doubts about my ability to decorate.<br><br>"It would look a lot better if there were a few clients sitting around in it."<br><br>"I'll get another case," I said, wondering if that was true. Six weeks is a long time for a detective to lay fallow. "Maybe we should celebrate the new office with a Bloody Mary?"<br><br>"There was a time when a woman couldn't walk in a bar and order a drink." Jitty's chocolate eyes sparkled.<br><br>The part about bars got my attention fast. "When did that change?"<br><br>"Your mother's generation. At least, that's when it became publicly acceptable for women to drink in bars. 'Course, women have always drunk liquor, and I'm not talkin' about a dainty glass of sherry. The rule was that decent women didn't drink." She raised perfectly shaped eyebrows. "I guess a gal like you would've ended up in the hoosegow or scrubbin' floors in some mission."<br><br>Jitty's point was well taken. I was benefiting from many generations of work on the part of courageous women who demanded change in the way their gender was viewed and treated. I sat down at my desk and put my feet up. "Okay, so I've come a long way, baby. I concede that point. How about an exhibit of the Charleston?"<br><br>"Sit up straight and quit actin' like some kind of tart," Jitty said. "Our work's not finished. Not by a long shot. It ain't time to put your feet up yet."<br><br>My glow of feminism paled. Jitty had an agenda; I was going to suffer. This was one equation that never failed to prove true. "I need a new case, Jitty, not a social conscience."<br><br>"You need both of them. But even that won't fulfill your female destiny. What you need is a man. You're the generation that can have it all, remember?"<br><br>Leave it to Jitty to state the obvious when my friends weren't doing it.<br><br>"Thanks. I'll check the newspaper and see if they have any good sales going on men." But she had backed herself into a corner, and I was going to enjoy watching her try to squirm out of it. "Think about it, though, Jitty. If I'm going to be the spearhead for women's rights in Sunflower County, I think it would look a lot better if I were independent. You know, one of the I-don't-need-a-man-for-nothin' women. If I had a husband, it would make me look like a hypocrite, don't you think?"<br><br>"Ticktock, Sarah Booth. You gonna rationalize yourself right into barrenness."<br><br>"Go away and leave me alone." Jitty knew my hot buttons way too well.<br><br>"I'll be back," she said, and though it was spoken in a soft drawl, it had the definite ring of the Terminator. And then she was gone.<br><br>My attention was drawn to the green Caddy coming down the driveway, and I felt a little tingle of happiness to see my partner arriving.<br><br>The new office had windows facing the front and the side, so I'd have a good view of anyone driving up. This is a great advantage for an investigator, who should always present the illusion of never being caught by surprise. I smiled at the thought of Jitty and her new obsession. Some would say I was discussing illusions with a delusion.<br><br>I heard Tinkie's rap at the front door. "Come in," I hollered. "I'm in the Peacock Suite." So called because of the huge vase of peacock feathers that stood in a corner of the room. I'd thought about removing them but decided Tinkie and I needed all the luck we could muster.<br><br>"What in the world are you doing on this side of the house? I was thinking when you called so early that you were probably making a batch of French toast. I just had my mouth set on--" She made it to the doorway and stopped.<br><br>Her gaze moved around the room, taking in every detail. At last it stopped at her desk and the nameplate. "Sarah Booth," she squealed in her best sorority sound of incommunicable happiness. She snatched up the nameplate. "It's wonderful!"<br><br>I was grinning big when Tinkie lowered Chablis to the floor and gave me a hug, her head tucked under my chin. The little Yorkie, delighted to be free, rushed toward the kitchen and my own dog, Sweetie Pie. The two were as unlikely a pair as Tinkie and I, but they were also great friends.<br><br>"I thought we needed a real office," I said.<br><br>"My name is on the door." There were tears in her eyes.<br><br>"You're half the agency."<br><br>"You're too much, Sarah Booth."<br><br>"And you're hungry. Let's go make some breakfast."<br><br>"French toast?"<br><br>"If that's what you'd like."<br><br>We were halfway to the kitchen when the red telephones began to ring. I'd stolen the red phone idea from Kinky Friedman, and I got a real thrill when they rang.<br><br>We rushed back to the office. I started to pick...</p><h2>The Book of Courage</h2><p>Writer and artist Hans Wilhelm delivers messages of comfort and courage in a book meant to inspire readers at times when their whole world seems falling down around them.

It was way the hell out in Malibu, and except for Nora Bishop, he and his wife, Alexa, weren't going to know anybody there. The party was to announce Nora's engagement to a movie producer named Farrell Champion, whom neither of them had met. Making it even worse, Shane and Alexa were cops and would probably stand out like psychiatrists at a Star Trek convention. They didn't understand movie people or Hollywood, with its strange language and customs. So Shane was more or less dreading it. <br><br>Alexa, on the other hand, could barely contain her excitement. She had spent at least two hours getting ready, which to tell the truth kind of pissed him off. One of the things he prized most about his beautiful black-haired wife was that she never made a big deal out of her appearance. She could show up most places wearing a horse blanket and look better than anybody there. <br><br>But all afternoon she had dithered and fussed until it had made them hopelessly late. <br><br>"You think these earrings are too gaudy? You think this blue-and-red scarf is too much with the tan skirt ...?" <br><br>"No, looks great ... love it ..." But it didn't matter what he thought, because she would just wrinkle her nose and stare at the clothing on the bed, then pull out a new ensemble. <br><br>Shane had dressed quickly, showering and combing his short black hair with his fingers. He glanced at his rugged angular face in the mirror. He was in his late thirties and his bony cheeks and hard, deep-set eyes reminded him of an over-the-hill, beat-up street fighter. It always surprised him when someone described him as handsome. At least, he marveled, he'd been lucky enough to jump the many hurdles required to marry the most beautiful woman on the LAPD. <br><br>They finally got in his Acura at five-thirty, left Venice, California, and headed toward Malibu. They were almost an hour late when they passed the old Getty Museum, then the Malibu Pier. Shane drove while Alexa chattered nervously. <br><br>"That last guy Nora dated, remember him, Shane? The one who traded futures on the stock exchange?" <br><br>"Yeah. Bill something, with the dimple in his chin ..." <br><br>"That fucking dimple was a surgical add-on," Alexa growled. "Boy, was I glad when Nora gave him the old flusheroo." <br><br>"Yep. Bill was sleaze." <br><br>"And remember Paul Bennett? Remember him? How on earth Nora ever decided to get entangled with Paul Bennett, with his polo ponies, which everyone thought he owned but it turned out he just rented, and the rented Ferrari ... he should've rented a personality." <br><br>"Yeah, Paul was definitely toe-jam. A skunk." <br><br>She turned and looked at him. "Are you humoring me, buddy?" She smiled. <br><br>"I agree Nora's been flying in a bug storm, but we don't know anything about this new guy either, except that he has a great press agent. He's in almost every national magazine." <br><br>"Whatta you mean we don't know? I've been talking to Nora about Farrell Champion since she started to decorate his Malibu house last year. He's the real deal-A-list all the way-and she's so happy, Shane. At last I think she's found Mr. Right." <br><br>"Yep, yep ... pretty exciting." God, he was dreading this party. <br><br>When they passed the Serra Retreat, the former mansion of the woman who once owned twenty miles of California coastline, Shane slowed the Acura and picked up the expensive invitation. It had a slightly corny Hollywood theme. On the top of the embossed card it said: "It's a Wrap on Farrell's Bachelorhood." There were some old-fashioned drawings of 35mm movie cameras, underscored by the inscription: "Come Help Us Celebrate Farrell's Biggest Epic Yet ... It's a Love Story." <br><br>He flipped it open to the map that showed where Farrell Champion's house was located behind the Colony gates in Malibu. <br><br>"I hate being late. Maybe we should just call in sick," he suggested, grinning. <br><br>"Nothing doing, you coward. Besides, I want to see the stars. I hear Julia Roberts is going to be there. Farrell produced one of her movies last year, and Nora said even Robert Downey, Jr." <br><br>"Shit, and us without our drug kits." <br><br>She punched him. "Stop it." She smiled. "You're gonna love it." <br><br>Seconds later they turned off the Coast Highway into the Colony. They pulled up to the guard, who frowned at the unwashed Acura. Then came the ritual giving and checking of names, the showing of the invitation. <br><br>They were validated. <br><br>A short drive down into the Malibu Colony and they were handing the dusty Acura over to a valet with surfer-blond hair wearing a red coat with gold buttons. It fit him better than Shane's blue blazer. Another valet was just driving a white Bentley away from in front of the house. <br><br>There were still a few tardy arrivals lined up at the front door. "See, we're not that late," Alexa said as she and Shane headed up the stone walkway. <br><br>Farrell Champion had built a French Provincial on two oceanfront lots. The house was grotesquely large, dwarfing its neighbors, and Shane thought it seemed pretentious and out of place, only forty yards from the crashing surf. <br><br>They got in line behind a beautiful woman who was wearing a beaded dress, very low cut, and an older gentleman with silver hair in a tuxedo with a black silk shirt-they looked like Bentley owners. <br><br>"We're underdressed," Alexa hissed in his ear as she looked at the woman's evening gown. Alexa had ended up wearing a white pantsuit with a wide belt and sandals. She looked gorgeous. Her blue eyes and sculpted face dominated a slender, athletic body. <br><br>Shane whispered back, "How can you underdress for a beach barbecue?" <br><br>The couple in front stepped over the threshold and Shane could hear a booming voice he guessed was Farrell Champion's, followed by Nora Bishop's tinkling laugh. <br><br>"Boris." Farrell's baritone. "Great opening weekend grosses on Horizon of the Damned. You're up five percent prorated from holiday weekend totals last year." <br><br>"But the P and A sure set us back a bundle," the tuxedoed man replied. "It's a step release. We're going wide next week ... twenty-six hundred screens." <br><br>"Thelma, you look devastating, as always...." Farrell again. <br><br>"Sorry about being so overdressed, Farrell. We're leaving here for Calvin's opening at the Taper." <br><br>Shane heard Alexa let out a sigh. <br><br>After a few air kisses, Thelma and Boris moved on. <br><br>Alexa was holding Shane's hand and she gave it a little hopeful squeeze. It was their turn. Show time. <br><br>They stepped into the magnificent, antiques-laden entry hall and Shane hugged Nora. She was a beautiful, dark-haired, forty-five-year-old woman with a sweet, tender quality that always made him want to protect her. She was also one of L.A.'s premiere interior decorators. In the last few years, Bishop Interiors had done a lot of the big homes in Beverly Hills, Malibu, and the Palisades. And despite her exposure to some of L.A.'s most demanding A-type personalities, Nora never provoked any discontent. She had a way of getting you to behave by making you feel good about yourself. She was ten years older than Alexa, and had been Alexa's babysitter back in Michigan when she was twelve. That was the year after Alexa's mother had died. Shane had always wondered if Nora's move to L.A. foreshadowed his wife's decision to come West as well, as if she needed to be close to Nora, who was like a big sister or maybe even a surrogate mother. <br><br>Alexa usually projected strength and determination, but around Nora she became strangely girlish. With Nora, she giggled. Sometimes, as Shane watched them together, he would get a glimpse of what his wife must have been like as a child. <br><br>"Shane, Alexa, thank you guys for coming. You're the best." Nora flashed her irresistible smile, then hugged Alexa. "I love that outfit, where did you get it?" <br><br>"This? It was on sale at May Company." Alexa wrinkled her nose in apology. "It's just an Adrienne Vittadini copy." <br><br>"On you it looks like a Dior original." Nora turned to the handsome fifty-five-year-old man beside her. "You guys haven't met Farrell. Farrell, these are my dearest friends in L.A., the Scullys." <br><br>Farrell grinned, and they shook hands and all started frantically searching for common ground. <br><br>"Nora, you didn't tell me Alexa would be so sexy. This is no meter maid you've got here, Shane." <br><br>Nine out of ten guys who said something like that would have pissed Shane off. Not that he was overly jealous, but there was some primal piece of him that didn't like handsome guys fawning over his wife or calling her sexy. But Farrell got away with it. Something in Farrell's demeanor said "Just kidding, don't take this the wrong way." He had a personality ... Shane hated the word, but okay, a vibe that was warm, engaging, and funny. In seconds, Shane could feel himself being won over. <br><br>Furthermore, Farrell Champion was extremely attractive and his looks drew you to him. He was fit, but not musclebound, not a fanatic. His silver-gray hair was swept back off his tanned forehead and his dark eyes looked right at you, focusing, making you feel important. <br><br>"What a beautiful house.... It's refreshing to see this kind of architecture on the beach." Shane couldn't believe such an egregiously phony sentence had come gushing out of him. <br><br>"Making movies isn't brain surgery, Shane. You gotta take all of this with a grain of salt," Farrell whispered with a wink. "No matter what anybody tells you, show business isn't creative art, it's a racket." <br><br>"Did you see the engagement ring?" Nora said, throwing her hand out for Alexa's examination. The diamond was huge-over six carats. <br><br>"My God, Nora, you must need someone to carry your hand around for you." <br><br>Farrell grinned. "Listen, you guys, I think everyone's here now, so I can stop standing in the entry like a nervous doorman. Come on in. Shane, can I get you and Alexa something? How about some white wine, or I have mixed drinks." <br><br>"Alexa likes chardonnay, I'll take scotch," Shane said. <br><br>Farrell steered Nora and Alexa into the plush living room full of beautiful people, then left them staring at the high-profile crowd while he headed toward the bar. Alexa grabbed Nora's hand and squeezed it. <br><br>"My God, Nora ... he's gorgeous." <br><br>"Not bad, huh?" Nora grinned back. "After all those foul tips, I finally got some wood on the ball." <br><br>Shane nodded and smiled broadly, the kind of smile you wear when you can't think of a damn thing to say. He had come here fully prepared to hate Farrell Champion ... hate him for his fame and success, his wealth and connections; hate him just for having a name like Farrell Champion. But in forty-five seconds or less, while standing in the doorway, Farrell had completely rewired all those feelings, leaving Shane groping for a new take. <br><br>Shane's eyes were sweeping the party. Everybody who was anybody in L.A. was there. He spotted faces he had only seen in People magazine. <br><br>"There's Kobe Bryant," he whispered, seeing the Lakers' great only a few feet away talking to ex-Mayor Riordan. Then Farrell was back, handing out drinks. <br><br>"Alexa, you had chardonnay ... Shane, scotch rocks-that's Dewar's, hope you like it ... Nora, here's your Campari and soda." Then Farrell took them both by the arm and steered them through the room. "Come on, let me introduce you to some friends." So off they went, on a celebrity tour of L.A. <br><br>"Nicole Kidman, this is Nora's dear friend Alexa Scully and her husband, Shane." The beautiful Australian actress smiled warmly, shook their hands, and they exchanged a few remarks. Then Farrell moved them on. "And this is L.A.'s resident bad boy, Jack the Mack ... Jacko, want you to meet some friends of Nora's ..." Jack fucking Nicholson, Shane thought, feeling starstruck as he shook the famous actor's hand. <br><br>More small talk until Farrell carried them along.... "Barbra and Jim live just down the street. Meet Nora's dear friends, Shane and Alexa." It was Streisand and Brolin. <br><br>It went on like that until finally Alexa got pulled away by Nora to meet some of the other bridesmaids, and Shane had to go to the bathroom. He used the one in the hall, thinking he was having a great time in spite of himself. This was one pretty amazing party. <br><br>When Shane came out of the bathroom he ran into the last person he would have ever expected to find at Farrell Champion's house.<br>Chapter Two <br><br>THE BAD JOKE<br> <br>Nicky Marcella was waiting to get into the guest john as Shane exited. They looked at each other like competing art thieves casing a Sotheby's auction. <br><br>"My God, Shane Scully," Nicky said. He was wearing a beautifully tailored, if somewhat gaudy, orangish-brown suit-or was it brownish-orange?-hard to tell because the colors strobed when he moved. Either way, it took some doing to pull off. Maybe the suit was helped by the fact that there wasn't all that much of it-Nicky being only five-foot-five, top to bottom, including his stacked Cuban heels. He was also rail thin-Mick Jagger thin. He had black hair, close-cut on the sides and slightly longer on the top. He was wearing an open-collared silk shirt with a few too many gold chains. His smile was warm, but he was narrow-faced and strangely ferretlike. <br><br>"Nicky, how you been?" <br><br>"Staying outta jail, I'll tell you that much." <br><br>"Glad to hear it," Shane said, and he was. He hadn't seen Marcella in four years. Nicky was a Hollywood character. When Shane met him he was doing street-corner cons-green-goods hustles and pigeon drops. Shane had first busted him when he was still a rookie working vice in Hollywood. He'd rolled him up twice more in the Valley when he was riding around in a plain Jane doing a straight eight in uniform. Sometime in the mid-nineties Nicky had switched from short cons to running bets for bookmakers, then had taken a short fall and ended up doing a bullet in County. When he got out, he moved on to straight-up bookmaking, writing betting slips out of a porn shop on Little Melrose. Nicky Marcella had dabbled in the criminal arts for almost the whole fifteen years Shane had known him, and now here he was, in Farrell Champion's house, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood's elite. <br><br>"Whatta you up to? Or should I just count the silver?" Shane smiled. <br><br>"Can't blame you for that, Shane. But I'm clean as the Board of Health these days. Just a minute, don't go away, gotta tap a kidney." <br><br>Nicky pushed past him into the bathroom while Shane stood outside wondering what on earth Nicky Marcella was doing at this party full of heavy-lifters. Even so, Shane had to admit that, over the years, he'd come to enjoy the guy. Nicky had an infectious personality and never took himself too seriously. Of course, he was shamefully easy to arrest, a wonderful quality in a criminal.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Stephen J.

John Baxter takes readers through 2,000 years of French history with tales of the kings, queens, saints, and sinners who shaped the city. Essays explore the major historic events from the martyrdom of Saint Denis near today&#x2019;s Abbesses M�tro station to the epic romances of Heloise and Abelard, Josephine and Napoleon, and George Sand and Fr�d�ric Chopin. Learn about the labyrinth of catacombs snaking under all of Paris and the artists who called the seedy Montmartre home in the 19th century. Then see it all for yourself with guided walking tours of each of Paris&#x2019;s historic neighborhoods, illustrated with color photographs and period maps.</p></p><p><p><b>John Baxter</b> is an Australian writer, journalist, and filmmaker. He is the author of<i> The Golden Moments of Paris,</i><i> Immoveable Feast: A Paris Christmas,</i> <i>The Most Beautiful Walk in the World: A Pedestrian in Paris</i>, and <i>We&#x2019;ll Always Have Paris: Sex and Love in the City of Light</i>.</p><p>This lovely, gorgeous and intelligent book examines the Paris of old and not so old, with its many fascinating figures and tales. Included in the short but insightful chapters are Marie Antoinette, whom author John Baxter calls misunderstood; the famous Paris Commune; the man behind the Eiffel Tower; Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Maurice Utrillo and other painters of the bohemian community of Montmartre; Paris and the Beat Generation; and the new wave films of Godard and Truffaut. Also here are Marcel Proust, Coco Chanel, Ernest Hemingway and Josephine Baker. Baxter describes detailed walking tours of the area surrounding the Paris Opera and the adjacent grand boulevards of Paris. He also includes the seedy but always fascinating Pigalle neighborhood and its Moulin Rouge dance hall, which is, Baxter notes, an expensive cabaret/restaurant and still features the can-can. There are the charming if touristy Montmartre; the crowded Latin Quarter and Notre Dame; the Saint-Germain-des-Pres neighborhood, once the haunt of jazz musicians, philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and members of the Lost Generation; the Luxembourg Gardens; artsy Montparnasse; and the Eiffel Tower. In addition to its fascinating details, the book is lavishly illustrated.</p><p>&#x2014;-Chicago Tribune<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Coco Chanel spent her teens during the late 1900s in a convent, where she learned the useful trade of dressmaking. This experience provided the foundation for the legendary French couturier&#x2019;s famed suits and "little black dresses." Chanel&#x2019;s story is just one chapter in the book Chronicles of Old Paris: Exploring the Historic City of Light. This fascinating read contains twenty-nine chapters, each including a brief story, photos, illustrations, and often a map of the area of the city where the tale took place. While this is a nonfiction book, it reads like fiction, whereby the reader journeys through Paris at different times in its history, through the stories of famous people and places. "Elle Est Partie! The Theft of the Mona Lisa" tells of the theft of the iconic painting from the Musee de Louvre in August, 1911. While the painting was ultimately found and the thief caught, the details of the heist and the mystery surrounding possible copies of the painting sold for a fortune make for a fascinating read. Marie Antoinette, wife of King Louis XVI, and infamous for telling her starving subjects, "Let them eat cake," was apparently innocent of that remark, according to Baxter. Was she also innocent of the many other wrongdoings for which she was accused and eventually executed in 1793? Many such stories have mysterious endings. In each of these short, punchy thumbnail sketches, readers learn about people in Paris but also about its history over the past several centuries. Marcel Proust, the Marquis de Sade, Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine, in addition to well-known and not so well-known authors, painters, architects, and courtesans, are among those presented. Who knew that the notorious guillotine was named after its designer, Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, a curiously staunch opponent of capital punishment? At the end of a chapter on Jean Moulin, leader of the French resistance against the Nazi occupation, a page is devoted to memorials to Moulin. It tells where Moulin&#x2019;s ashes are interred, indicates the building where the first meeting of the resistance committee took place, and describes the Musee Jean Moulin, where the French hero&#x2019;s papers are on display. A map pinpoints those areas for tourists and Paris residents, as well as the armchair visitor. The style of writing is crisp and newsy. Small enough to carry in one&#x2019;s purse or briefcase, Chronicle of Old Paris can be opened during a lull, sitting in the doctor&#x2019;s waiting room or riding a bus, and the reader treated to a fascinating tale about the famous and infamous City of Lights.</p><p>&#x2014;-ForeWord<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Continuing the publisher&#x2019;s series (after James Roman&#x2019;s Chronicles of Old Las Vegas), Baxter (The Most Beautiful Walk in the World: A Pedestrian in Paris) gives travelers quick insights into the colorful history of Paris. There&#x2019;s something here for everyone, from artists (Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, surrealism, and the artist community of Montmartre) to history buffs (the Resistance) to writers (George Sand and Ernest Hemingway) and musicians (Django Reinhardt and Josephine Baker) to monarchy enthusiasts (Marie Antoinette) and architecture fans (Eiffel Tower, Opera Garnier). Each chapter gives a brief history of the subject matter and a short list of related sites, plus a small map that includes subway stops, though the lack of footnotes and references limits this book&#x2019;s use for a history report or research paper. The end of the guide includes walking tours by neighborhood for those looking for a more traditional, geographic approach. VERDICT A fun, supplemental travel book for those seeking to go beyond the traditional tourist spots an additional guide is necessary for basic travel information. Sara A. Miller, Atlanta-Fulton P.L.

There's one haiku for each night, and stepped pages add one candle to the menorah every time the page is turned. The simple poetry is set off perfectly by Karla Gudeon's vibrant, freewheeling artwork. A perfect gift, or good to reread each year, <em>Hanukkah Haiku</em> is a jubilant, unforgettable journey through the eight nights of Hanukkah.</p><p>Harriet Ziefert has vivid childhood memories of lighting the Hanukkah candles with her maternal grandfather, who always took her hand in his as he held the Shammash.<br><br>Karla Gudeon's paintings and prints are joyful representations of life, love, family, and Jewish ritual and culture.

Karla lives in New York with Kevin, Sam and Max, and Lila Mae.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;Combining festive illustrations and a playful format, this title uses haiku to celebrate the eight nights of Hanukkah. While the selections address only the most basic ideas (Four candles tonight./Grandma fries the latkes brown./We want applesauce), each turn of the stepped pages brings fresh excitement as another lit candle and verse are revealed. Illustrations have a lovely folkloric quality in which Chagall-like figures, surrounded by richly colored flowers and stars, float across a fibrous tan background. Of particular note are the gorgeous patterned edges on the versos that mirror the tones of the newly exposed candle. Endnotes include an explanation of the candle blessings.

Carbonate petrography can be quite complicated. Changing assemblages of organisms through time, coupled with the randomness of thin-section cuts through complex shell forms, add to the difficulty of identifying skeletal grains. Furthermore, because many primary carbonate grains are composed of unstable minerals (especially aragonite and high-Mg calcite), diagenetic alteration commonly is quite extensive in carbonate rocks. The variability of inorganic and biogenic carbonate mineralogy through time, however, complicates prediction of patterns of diagenetic alteration.<p>This book is designed to help deal with such challenges. It includes a wide variety of examples of commonly encountered skeletal and nonskeletal grains, cements, fabrics, and porosity types. It includes extensive new tables of age distributions, mineralogy, morphologic characteristics, environmental implications and keys to grain identification. It also encompasses a number of noncarbonate grains, that occur as accessory minerals in carbonate rocks or that may provide important biostratigraphic or paleoenvironmental information in carbonate strata. With this guide, students and other workers with little formal petrographic training should be able to examine thin sections or acetate peels under the microscope and interpret the main rock constituents and their depositional and diagenetic history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Restoring Your Spiritual Passion</h2><p>Why is there so much dissatisfaction with our lives?

When Agatha, who just happens to be handling the PR for the water company, finds the council chairman murdered at the basin of the spring, tongues start wagging. Could one of the council members have polished off the chairman before he could cast the deciding vote? Poor Agatha, still nursing a bruised heart from one of her unsuccessful romantic encounters, must get cracking, investigate the councillors and solve the crime. Praise for the Agatha Raisin series: &#39;M. C. Beaton&#39;s imperfect heroine is an absolute gem.&#39; Publishers Weekly &#39;The detective novels of M. C. Beaton, a master of outrageous black comedy, have reached cult status.&#39; The Times &#39;Being a cranky, middle-aged female myself, I found Agatha charming!&#39; Amazon customer review &#39;Agatha Raisin is sharp, witty, hugely intelligent, unfailingly entertaining, delightfully intolerant and oh so magnificently non PC. M C Beaton has created a new national treasure...the stories zing along and are irresistible, unputdownable, a joy. If you buy one book a year, let it be this. Agatha Raisin is The Strongest Link.&#39; Anne Robinson</p><p>Agatha Raisin, the crusty, yet perversely self-conscious Londoner who has resettled in the ostensible calm of a Cotswold village stars in her seventh adventure by M.C. Beaton. In this episode, Agatha has agreed to come out of retirement to manage the publicity for the launch of water bottled from a village spring--much to the chagrin of some of her neighbors. Worried that the commodification of at least part of the village's charm might wreak havoc on their peaceful existence, some of the community try to stop it once and for all. Still, killing off a member of the village council and leaving the corpse in the spring itself seems a little extreme, especially as it makes Agatha's paying job a bit more difficult. Believing that a dead body might destroy the chances for a successful campaign to market her product, Agatha begins an investigation into who might have wanted the victim dead. <p> Agatha Raisin continues to be an engaging and slightly puzzling heroine in <i>The Wellspring of Death</i>. She careens around the Cotswolds asking impertinent questions regarding the personal lives of her neighbors, all the while wondering why so many of them are unpleasant to her. She manages to muddle her own romantic affairs to such an extent that she finds herself in bed with her young and handsome employer--to the dismay of her former fianc�e. Yet, in spite of all this, she engages in the occasional humorous assessment of what life among charming fa�ades and lovely vistas is really like (crowded shopping in too small stores) and has a peculiarly British obsession with class and accent. There is much to appreciate here and little that is daunting or dismal. <i>--K.A. Crouch</i></p>Praise for <i>Agatha Raisin</i>:<p> "Beaton has a winner in the irrepressible, romance-hungry Agatha." --<i>Chicago Sun Times</i></p><p> "[Agatha] is a glorious cross between Miss Marple, Auntie Mame and Lucille Ball, with a tad of pit bull tossed in. She's wonderful." --<i>St. Petersburg Times</i></p><p> "[Agatha] is an absolute gem." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p> "Anyone interested in a few hours' worth of intelligent, amusing reading will want to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Agatha Raisin." --<i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i></p></p><h2>Thirteen Uncollected Stories By John Cheever</h2><p>A gathering of thirteen never-before-collected stories, originally published in the 1930s and 1940s, shows Cheever&#39;s use of unusual themes, techniques, and characters early in his career and gives a vivid picture of life during the Depression.</p><p>After years of litigation between the publisher and Cheever's estate, this collection of 13 stories now in the public domain proves something of a disappointment. While Cheever fans will be grateful for a sampling of his juvenilia, others should be warned that these pieces are hardly typical of his best work. Most first appeared in the 30's and bear the marks of their time as well as the influence of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Depression fiction. The earliest stories, from small avant-garde magazines, stress atmosphere over character; they're bleak, abstract expressions of social jitters during an anxious era of poverty and decline. When Cheever begins to find a voice, his fictions become more convincing. A pre-Miller, post-Dreiser traveling shoe-salesman (``The Autobiography of a Drummer'') laments his once thriving business. ``In Passing'' records Cheever's dissatisfaction with left-wing ideology as his young protagonist drifts through lean times. A number of stories deal with working women at turning points: a waitress who suddenly realizes how empty her routine is (``Bayonne''); a hard-working dancer, hired to lend legitimacy to a strip show, who loses herself in her stage persona (``The Princess''); a 52-year-old stripper who, with great dignity, shows she hasn't lost it (``The Teaser''); and a young nanny who reveals a surprisingly refined aesthetic sense (``The Opportunity''). Equally clever and in the same commercial vein are three stories from Collier's, all set on the fringes of high society in the world of horse-racing. With an O. Henryish twist, ``His Young Wife'' pits an older man against his wife's infatuation with a gambler her own age; ``Saratoga'' also testifies to the gambler's insatiable habits; and in ``The Man She Loved,'' a socially ambitious dowager manqu&#x201a; is determined that her daughter marry well. Cruel fate, not dysfunction, reigns in these clever narratives. At best, middle-brow fiction in the O'Hara-Cozzens mold. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Having failed in a previous effort to publish a much larger collection because of opposition from the Cheever family, the publisher here offers a truncated selection of stories now in the public domain. This is still a book well worth having, showing the earliest work of a writer who went on to greater things but who even in his creative youth showed ample evidence of his gifts. The earliest stories, written when the author was barely out of his teens, are heavily influenced by Hemingway and the dour social realism of the Depression. With "The Autobiography of a Drummer" (1935), however, though the social conscience remains, a real voice, capable of remarkable mimicry, is emerging. This is a short, painful tale with something of the impact of Death of a Salesman . And "In Passing" (1936), a touching parable about a crumbling family and a rootless Communist agitator, has real force. "Bayonne" and "The Princess" are well-observed character sketches of tough-vulnerable women of the time, and "The Man She Loved"--set, like several of these stories, in Saratoga, where Cheever was a resident at the Yaddo writers' colony--shows how cleverly he can build surprising confrontations by indirection. It is always good to see a great writer advancing in his craft, and it is a shame the collection could not have been much more extensive. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Did You Know?

A voracious private reader, she left her regular studies at fourteen to attend art school. In 1950 her first children's book was published, and from then on, she devoted her time and talents to writing children's historical novels. Many of her books are set in Roman Britain, a period that particularly interested her. She received the OBE in 1975 and, in 1992, was awarded the CBE. She was still writing on the morning of her death at the age of seventy-two.</p><b>The Saxon Shore</b> <p>On a blustery autumn day a galley was nosing up the wide loop of a British river that widened into the harbour of Rutupiae.</p><p>The tide was low, and the mud-banks at either hand that would be covered at high tide were alive with curlew and sandpiper. And out of the waste of sandbank and sour salting, higher and nearer as the time went by, rose Rutupiae: the long, whale-backed hump of the island and the grey ramparts of the fortress, with the sheds of the dockyard massed below it.</p><p>The young man standing on the fore-deck of the galley watched the fortress drawing nearer with a sense of expectancy; his thoughts reaching alternately forward to the future that waited for him there, and back to a certain interview that he had had with Licinius, his Cohort Commander, three months ago, at the other end of the Empire. That had been the night his posting came through.</p><p>&#x201c;You do not know Britain, do you?&#x201d; Licinius had said.</p><p>Justin&#x2014;Tiberius Lucius Justinianus, to give him his full name as it was inscribed on the record tablets of the Army Medical Corps at Rome&#x2014;had shaken his head, saying with the small stutter that he could never quite master, &#x201c;N-no, sir. My grandfather was born and bred there, but he settled in Nicaea when he left the Eagles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And so you will be eager to see the province for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, only&#x2014;I scarcely expected to be sent there with the Eagles.&#x201d;</p><p>He could remember the scene so vividly. He could see Licinius watching him across the crocus flame of the lamp on his table, and the pattern that the wooden scroll-ends made on their shelves, and the fine-blown sand-wreaths in the corners of the mud-walled office; he could hear distant laughter in the camp, and, far away, the jackals crying; and Licinius&#x2019;s dry voice:</p><p>&#x201c;Only you did not know we were so friendly with Britain, or rather, with the man who has made himself Emperor of Britain?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, sir, it does seem strange. It is only this spring that Maximian sent the Caesar C-Constantius to drive him out of his Gaulish territory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree. But there are possible explanations to these postings from other parts of the Empire to the British Legions. It may be that Rome seeks, as it were, to keep open the lines of communication. It may be that she does not choose that Marcus Aurelius Carausius should have at his command Legions that are completely cut away from the rest of the Empire. That way comes a fighting force that follows none but its own leader and owns no ties whatsoever with Imperial Rome.&#x201d; Licinius had leaned forward and shut down the lid of the bronze ink-stand with a small deliberate click. &#x201c;Quite honestly, I wish your posting had been to any other province of the Empire.&#x201d;</p><p>Justin had stared at him in bewilderment. &#x201c;Why so, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I knew your father, and therefore take a certain interest in your welfare...How much do you in fact understand about the situation in Britain? About the Emperor Carausius, who is the same thing in all that matters?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very little, I am afraid, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well then, listen, and maybe you will understand a little more. In the first place, you can rid your mind of any idea that Carausius is framed of the same stuff as most of the six-month sword-made Emperors we have had in the years before Diocletian and Maximian split the Purple between them. He is the son of a German father and a Hibernian mother, and that is a mixture to set the sparks flying; born and bred in one of the trading-stations that the Manopeans of the German sea set up long since in Hibernia, and only came back to his father&#x2019;s people when he reached manhood. He was a Scaldis river-pilot when I knew him first. Afterward he broke into the Legions&#x2014;the gods know how. He served in Gaul and Illyria, and under the Emperor Carus in the Persian War, rising all the time. He was one of Maximian&#x2019;s right-hand men in suppressing the revolts in eastern Gaul, and made such a name for himself that Maximian, remembering his naval training, gave him command of the fleet based on Gesoriacum, and the task of clearing the Northern Seas of the Saxons swarming in them.&#x201d;</p><p>Licinius had broken off there, seeming lost in his own thoughts, and in a little, Justin had prompted respectfully, &#x201c;Was not there a t-tale that he let the Sea Wolves through on their raids and then fell on them when they were heavy with spoil on their h-homeward way?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye&#x2014;and sent none of the spoil to Rome. It was that, I imagine, that roused Maximian&#x2019;s ire. We shall never know the rights of that tale; but at all events Maximian ordered his execution, and Carausius got wind of it in time and made for Britain, followed by the whole Fleet. He was ever such a one as men follow gladly. By the time the official order for his execution was at Gesoriacum, Carausius had dealt with the Governor of Britain, and proclaimed himself Emperor with three British Legions and a large force from Gaul and Lower Germany to back his claim, and the sea swept by his galleys between him and the executioner. Aye, better galleys and better seamen than ever Maximian could lay his hands to. And in the end Maximian had no choice but to make peace and own him for a brother Emperor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we have not k-kept the peace,&#x201d; Justin had said bluntly after a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;No. And to my mind Constantius&#x2019;s victories in North Gaul this spring are more shame to us than defeat could have been. No blame to the young Caesar; he is a man under authority like the rest of us, though he will sit in Maximian&#x2019;s place one day...Well, the peace abides&#x2014;after a fashion. But it is a situation that may burst into a blaze at any hour, and if it does, the gods help anyone caught in the flames.&#x201d; The Commander had pushed back his chair and risen, turning to the window. &#x201c;And yet, in an odd way, I think I envy you, Justin.&#x201d;</p><p>Justin had said, &#x201c;You liked him, then, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>And he remembered now how Licinius had stood looking out into the moonlit night. &#x201c;I&#x2014;have never been sure,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I would have followed him into the mouth of Erebos itself,&#x201d; and turned back to the lamp.</p><p>That had been almost all, save that at the last Licinius had stayed him in the doorway, saying, &#x201c;If you should at any time have speech with the great man himself, salute him from me, and ask him if he remembers the boar we killed below the pine woods at the third bend of the Scaldis.&#x201d;</p><p>But it was scarcely likely, Justin thought, that a Junior Surgeon would have the chance to give any message to the Emperor Carausius.</p><p>He came back to the present with a jerk, to find that they had entered a world of stone-and-timber jetties, ringed round with sail-lofts and armourers&#x2019; shops and long-boat sheds, threading their way among the galleys that lay at anchor in the sheltered water. The mingled reek of pitch and salt-soaked timber and hot metal was in his nostrils; and above the beat of the galley&#x2019;s oars and the liquid rush of water parting under the bows, he could hear the mingled myriad beehive hum of planes and saws and hammers on anvils that was the voice of a dockyard all the world over. And above him towered the ramparts of Rutupiae; a grey prow of ramparts raw with newness, from the midst of which sprang the beacon-crested tower of the Light.</p><p>A while later, having landed and reported to the Commandant and to the Senior Surgeon, having left his kit in the lime-washed cell in the officers&#x2019; block that had been assigned to him, and set out in search of the bathhouse and lost his way in the crowded unfriendly immensity of the huge fortress, Justin was standing close before that tower.</p><p>The thing was no match for the Pharos at Alexandria, but seen at close quarters it was vast enough to stop one&#x2019;s breath, all the same. In the centre of the open space rose a plinth of solid masonry four or five times the height of a man, and long as an eighty-oar galley, from the midst of which a tower of the same grey stone-work soared heavenward, bearing on its high crest the iron beacon brazier that seemed to Justin, staring giddily up at it, almost to touch the drifting November skies. The gulls rose and fell about it on white wings, and he heard their thin, remote crying above the busy sounds of the fortress; then, with his head beginning to swim, brought his gaze down as far as the top of the plinth. Curved ramps for the fuel-carts led up to it at either end, and from them roofed colonnades ran in to the base of the tower itself; and now that he had got over the stupendous size of the thing enough to take in the details, he saw that the columns and cornices were of marble, enriched with statues and splendid carvings, but that they were broken and falling into decay, which was strange, here in the midst of a fortress so new that in places they were still at work on the walls. But there was broken marble everywhere, some of it roughly stacked as though for use at a future time, some clinging yet to the stark grey walls that it had once covered. A small piece that must have fallen from its fellows when being carried away lay almost at his feet and, stooping to pick it up, he saw that it was part of a sculptured laurel-wreath.</p><p>He was still holding the fragment of marble and gazing up at the great tower from which it had fallen, when a voice behind him said, &#x201c;Pretty, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; and he swung round to find standing at his elbow a very dusty young man in Centurion&#x2019;s uniform, with his helmet under one arm; a stocky, red-haired young man with a thin, merry face and fly-away eyebrows, who seemed friendly.</p><p>&#x201c;It is half ruined,&#x201d; Justin said, puzzled. &#x201c;What is it? I mean, I can see it is a pharos, b-but it looks as though it was meant to be something else as well.&#x201d;</p><p>A shadow of bitte...</p></p><h2>Love&#39;s Blood The Shocking True Story Of A: Teenager Who Would Do Anything for the Older Man She Loved--Even Kill Her Whole Family</h2><p>A portrait of a teenage girl convicted in the brutal slayings of her father, mother, and brother looks at the causes, events and aftermath of the crime</p><p>Deeply engaging tale of a teenager who may--or may not--have helped kill her parents. This is Clark's 20th work of mystery or true crime (Hard City, 1990, etc.). There's no question that Patricia Ann Columbo, 19, and her longtime sexual-sociopath lover, Frank DeLuca, 37, were involved in the murder of Patti's parents and her brother Michael, 13, in the family's Elk Grove Village, Illinois, home on a bloody spring night in 1976. But as the grisly details gather here, you note that Patti is never actually seen with weapon in hand--and by book's end you're likely to conclude that there's considerable evidence that Patti killed no one. Although she conspired with two men she thought were mob hit men to have her parents and brother killed, it seems that Patti's paranoid boyfriend actually did the deed in a fit of fear and rage that erupted during the perfect moment for a triple murder. Guilt fell first on Patti, who, upon her arrest, claimed to be able to remember that night only as if in a vision- -and, by the close here, it becomes clear how the hysterical teenager, who was in the house but not in the murder rooms, could remember the night of the killings only in a surreal way. Much of Howard's story comes from Patti herself, now 37, whom the author interviewed at length in prison, where she's serving a 200-to-300- year sentence. Howard takes no sides and is a model of evenhanded true-crime writing. Although paced for snails, with invented dialogue and much graphic lovemaking, his narrative keeps a tight grip, especially with Patti's forbidden 15-year-old body--and its ripening--as the emotional focus. A rich mix of sex and blood with eroticism too strong for any Amy Fisher-type TV miniseries--though it's a Drew Barrymore natural.

Her father, a businessman who may have had Mafia ties, idealized her as his "little princess," failing to see her as a real person. Her mother, focused on assuring that the father was never upset, was cold and distant toward her daughter. An uncle abused her sexually throughout her childhood. Then, at age 15, Patricia fell in love with Frank DeLuca, a womanizing pharmacist in his mid-30s who introduced her to many varieties of sex and eventually left his wife and five children for her. Their affair culminated in 1976, when Patricia's father, mother and 13-year-old brother were shot, bludgeoned and stabbed to death in their suburban home. DeLuca and Patricia were found guilty and sentenced to 200- to 300-year prison terms. Howard ( Six Against the Rock ), the first writer to whom Patricia granted interviews, presents a vivid, captivating, exhaustively researched case history (and study of woman as victim). We never learn exactly what happened the night of the murders, however--several versions are offered, and readers are left to make their own determinations. Photos not seen by PW.

For the journey, he procured an authentic dugout cedar canoe from an Indigenous village on the east coast of Vancouver Island.</p> <p>For three years Voss and the&nbsp;<em>Tilikum</em>, aided by a rotating cast of characters, visited Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil and finally England, weathering heavy gales at sea and attracting large crowds of spectators on shore. The austere on-board conditions and simple navigational equipment Voss used throughout the voyage are a testimony to his skill and to the solid construction of the Nuu-Chah-Nulth vessel.</p> <p>Both Voss and his original mate, newspaperman N.K. Luxton, later wrote about their journey in accounts compromised by poor memories, brazen egos and outright lies. Stories of murder, cannibalism and high-seas terror have been repeated elsewhere without any regard to the truth. Now, over a century later, a full and fair account of the voyage&#x2015;and the magnitude of Voss&#x2019;s accomplishment&#x2015;is at last fully detailed.</p> <p>In this groundbreaking work, marine historians John MacFarlane and Lynn Salmon sift fact from fiction, critically examining the claims of Voss&#x2019;s and Luxton&#x2019;s manuscripts against research from libraries, archives, museums and primary sources around the world. Including unpublished photographs, letters and ephemera from the voyage,&nbsp;<em>Around the World in a Dugout Canoe</em>&nbsp;tells the real story of a little-understood character and his cedar canoe. It is an enduring story of courage, adventure, sheer luck and at times tragedy.</p></p><p><p><strong>John M</strong><strong>ac</strong><strong>Farlane</strong>&nbsp;is the curator emeritus of the Maritime Museum of British Columbia, curator of the Nauticapedia Project and author of a number of books and articles on nautical history.

Staggered by the deaths of his mother and wife on the same tragic night, Teddy Roosevelt was returning to a place he had visited the year before, a place that had struck him with its fierce beauty and its bounty of big game and big opportunity. By the Little Missouri River, Teddy Roosevelt established a ranching empire, and soon stood at the center of a storm...</p><p><b>AND IN A VIOLENT LAND, HE WAS REBORN...</b><br>Less than a decade after an Indian rebellion and the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Dakota was being settled by the brave, the ambitious, and the restless. While some men were grabbing power, some were getting away with murder. For Roosevelt, using local cowboys and transplanted Easterners as his ranch hands, this was a place to make his mark, to make a stand and to look a killer in the eye. And this was a time to bring wild Dakota into the heart of America...</p></p><p><p>MATT BRAUN was a fourth generation Westerner, steeped in the tradition and lore of the frontier era. His books reflect a heritage rich with the truths of that bygone time. Raised among the Cherokee and Osage tribes, Braun learned their traditions and culture, and their philosophy became the foundation of his own beliefs. Like his ancestors, he spent most of his life wandering the mountains and plains of the West. His heritage and his contribution to Western literature resulted in his appointment by the Governor of Oklahoma as a Territorial Marshal.</p><p>Braun was the author of forty-seven novels and four nonfiction works, including <i>Black Fox</i>, which was made into a CBS miniseries. Western Writers of America awarded Braun the prestigious Spur Award for his novels <i>Dakota </i>and <i>The Kincaids </i>and the 2004 Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement in Western Literature. Braun passed away in 2016.</p><p>ONE<br>Roosevelt wouldn&#x2019;t allow himself to believe they were dying.<br>The night train from Albany rattled along through the darkened countryside. Dimmed lanterns swayed overhead, lighting the passenger coach, his features reflected in the grimy window. He looked exactly the way he felt, drained and stunned, his eyes rimmed with despair. He refused to yield to the terror that pulsed in his heart.<br>Five days ago, when he&#x2019;d left New York City, Dr. Murdock, the attending physician, had assured him there was no reason for concern. His mother was bedridden with a severe cold, and his wife, expecting their first child, seemed normal. His responsibilities as an assemblyman in the state legislature and a leading voice in the Republican Party required his vote on impending legislation. He was loathe to leave, but the doctor had again reassured him that his anxiety was unwarranted. He&#x2019;d caught the Sunday train for Albany, the state capital.<br>Just that morning, a crisp, snowy Thursday, he had received a telegram from his brother, Elliot. The message informed him that his wife, Alice, had given birth to a healthy baby girl and was doing fairly well, considering it was her first delivery. The date was February 14, 1884, and Roosevelt, euphoric with the news, thought it auspicious that his daughter had been born on St. Valentine&#x2019;s Day. His colleagues in the legislature, when he entered chambers for a critical vote on civic reform, pummeled him with congratulations. He was proud as punch.<br>&#x201c;Wonderful news, Theodore,&#x201d; one of his friends said, pumping his arm. &#x201c;How does it feel to be a father?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;By Godfrey!&#x201d; Roosevelt replied with a nutcracker grin. &#x201c;I never imagined it would be so grand.&#x201d;<br>But now, as he stared out the train window, the words rang hollow. Late that afternoon, when the legislature adjourned for the day, he had returned to his office. His secretary handed him another telegram, and he&#x2019;d fully expected a glowing report on mother and child. Upon opening the envelope, his face went ashen as he scanned the message, and a chilling numbness struck at his very core. The text was a death knell, short and brutal. Too much to comprehend.<br>Mother is dying, and Alice is dying too.<br>Come quickly.<br>Elliot<br>Even on the best of days, there was no quick way from Albany to New York City. The train was slowed by snow squalls in the north and thick ground fog to the south along the Hudson River. The slow, tortuous journey was all but unbearable, and mile-by-mile, alternating between prayers and a sense of desolation, Roosevelt&#x2019;s thoughts skewed wildly from hope to abject fear. One moment he believed the God he worshipped would show infinite mercy, and the next he dreaded he would be too late. He cursed himself for not being there, for having left when he should have stayed.<br>The train pulled into Grand Central Station shortly after ten o&#x2019;clock. Roosevelt was out the vestibule door before the coaches stopped rolling, and hurried up the stairway to the main terminal. The central chamber was a vast beaux arts amphitheater, with vaulted arches, massive stained-glass windows, and the constellations of the zodiac wrought in gold against blue on a majestic ceiling. He marched through the terminal as though blind to the airy marble colossus.<br>People invariably noticed Roosevelt and were quick not to block his path. He stood four inches shy of six feet and weighed perhaps 150 pounds when fully clothed. Yet he was unusually muscular, with a bull-like chest and a thick neck that strained against his shirt collar. His eyes were pale blue, pince-nez glasses squeezed onto his nose over a full mustache, and brushy side whiskers emphasized his hard, square jaw. His expression was offset by a mouthful of dazzling tombstone teeth and bordered on the snarl of a man peering directly into the sun. He looked like he could walk through granite.<br>Outside the terminal he caught a hansom cab on Forty Second Street. The broad thoroughfare and nearby buildings were all but invisible in a dense drizzling mist. For the past ten days the city had been enveloped in a fog so pervasive that there was little difference between dawn and dusk. The air smelled of sodden ashes, for homes and businesses were heated by coal, and street lamps appeared shrouded in a viscous gray gauze. The driver held his horse to a cautious walk in the soupy murk.<br>Roosevelt was reminded of a similar night, just six years ago. An undergraduate at Harvard, he&#x2019;d taken the train from Boston after being notified his father was mortally ill. Theodore Senior was a partner in an importing firm, a millionaire several times over, and the Roosevelts were among the inner circle of New York aristocracy. Only forty-six, he had taken ill suddenly and died three days later of a malignant tumor of the bowel. A noted philanthropist, Theodore Senior had been a man of tireless vitality, whose love of family was matched by his compassion for the poor. Roosevelt still thought of him by the name he&#x2019;d secretly invented as a child&#x2014;Greatheart.<br>Three years later, in the summer of 1880, Roosevelt had graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. He and Alice had married that fall, shortly before he enrolled as a law student at New York&#x2019;s Columbia University. His father&#x2019;s idealism led him to consider a career generally shunned by the wealthier class but one that enabled him to champion the rights of the downtrodden. In 1881 he joined the Republican Party, and at age twenty-three he was the youngest man ever elected to the New York State Legislature. His meteoric rise was attributed to his combative stance against the corrupt politics of Tammany Hall, and last November he had been elected to a third term in the legislature. The New York Times, in a recent article, hailed him as &#x201c;the most remarkable young politician of our day.&#x201d;<br>Tonight Roosevelt would have traded it all for a reversal of what he feared awaited him at home. As the cab drew to a halt before the mansion at 6 West Fifty Seventh Street, he jumped out and handed a wad of bills to the driver. Through the fog, Roosevelt saw the dull glow of lamps inside, and he hurried up the steps and rapped sharply on the door. A moment elapsed, and he was about to knock again when the door opened. Elliot, who was two years younger, pulled him into the vestibule. Elliot&#x2019;s expression was stark.<br>&#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I prayed you would make it in time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d; Roosevelt demanded. &#x201c;Mother and Alice were perfectly fine when I left for Albany.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dr. Murdock will have to explain it. I still find it all so... incomprehensible.&#x201d;<br>Anna and Corinne, Roosevelt&#x2019;s sisters, rushed from the parlor into the hallway. Anna, fondly known as &#x201c;Bamie,&#x201d; was the oldest at twenty-nine and seemed destined for the life of a spinster. Corinne was the baby of the family, scarcely twenty-two, and already married. Bamie threw herself into Roosevelt&#x2019;s arms.<br>&#x201c;Oh, Teddy!&#x201d; she cried in a shaky voice. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t bring myself to believe we might lose them.&#x201d;<br>Roosevelt hugged her and drew Corinne into the embrace. The mansion was three stories, lavishly furnished with Persian carpets in every room and an ornate hand-carved staircase leading to the upper floors. Usually alive with laughter and gaiety, the house was now eerily quiet. Bamie sniffled, her eyes moist with tears, and Roosevelt patted her shoulder.<br>&#x201c;Where is Dr. Murdock?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I must speak with him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the parlor,&#x201d; Corinne said softly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for you.&#x201d;<br>Dr. Harold Murdock was a short, stout man with a mane of white hair. He was standing before a blazing fireplace when they came through the doorway to the parlor. His features were dour as he moved forward to shake hands with Roosevelt. Watching them, Elliot was struck again by his brother&#x2019;s force of character. Whenever he entered a room, he radiated such a sense of voltage that he immediately became the central presence. Tonight he seemed somehow larger than life in a house of death.<br>&#x201c;I require an explanation,&#x201d; he said with a perfunctory handshake. &#x201c;On Sunday, you assured me there was no reason for concern. What has happened to change your diagnosis?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your mother contracted pneumonia,&#x201d; Murdock said frankly. &#x201c;Her condition deteriorated overnight, and the suddenness of it has no medical explanation. She was simply too frail to fight it off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you saying there&#x2019;s nothing to be done?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing known to medical science, Mr. Roosevelt. Only the very strong of constitution survive pneumonia.&#x201d;<br>Bamie snuffled quietly while Corinne and Elliot averted their eyes. Roosevelt stared directly at the physician. &#x201c;And what of my wife?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bright&#x2019;s disease,&#x201d; Murdock informed him. &#x201c;In layman&#x2019;s terms, irreversible failure of the kidneys. She&#x2019;s probably had it for some time, a dormant strain. Lying in wait.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lying in wait for what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A stress to the system too grievous to endure. Quite likely, the rigors of childbirth unleashed toxins into her system. Her delivery was long, and difficult.&#x201d;<br>Roosevelt frowned. &#x201c;You couch these terms in a certain vagary, Doctor. Perhaps we need another medical opinion.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I felt so, too,&#x201d; Murdock said. &#x201c;Dr. John Phelps, chief surgeon at St. Luke&#x2019;s, was here this afternoon. He concurs with what is now my prognosis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Prognosis, as in final, if I understand the distinction. Are you convinced there&#x2019;s no hope?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I regret to say that is correct, Mr. Roosevelt.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made no mention of the baby. Is she well?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your daughter is quite healthy, perfectly f...</p></p><h2>Holocaust And Memory In The Global Age (Politics History &amp; Social Chan)</h2><p>In The Holocaust and Memory in the Global Age, Daniel Levy and Natan Sznaider examine the distinctive forms that collective memory take in the age of globalisation. Levy and Sznaider examine the way the Holocaust has been remembered in Germany, Israel, and the US during the last fifty years, and show how this singular event has been detached from its precise context and instead used as a way of focusing abstract questions of good and evil, and how this use has given the Holocaust a resonance across the global stage, as responses to other injustices like ethnic cleansing in Bosnia have depended on a collective understanding of the Holocaust to justify such actions.</p><p>How collective memory of the Holocaust advances human rights in the Global Age"Levy and Sznaider successfully demonstrate why 'holocaust'is no longer an exclusively Jewish or German concern. Their treatment of how the Holocaust is remembered, taught, memorialized, studied, and incorporated into law and policy in each of the three countries [Israel, Germany, and the US] as well as internationally is empirically rich and informative. Their larger argument about the decoupling of collective memory from national boundaries and the emergence of cosmopolitan meanings and concern is ingenious." &#x2014;David Abraham, University of Miami School of Law</p><h2>The Ugly Stepsisters (Walt Disney Fun-To-Read Library, Volume 6)</h2><p>Cinderella&#39;s stepsisters come to sit and visit Cinderella in her new castle.

Together, as husband and wife, we have traversed the vast regions of Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Kansas, the Dakotas, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have read and reread many history books on the nineteenth-century old West, and between us have read literally hundreds of novels about it. From Daniel Boone to Davey<br>Crockett; from Kit Carson to Wyatt Earp; from Wild Bill Hickok to Buffalo Bill Cody, our national folklore is replete with rugged men finding their dreams fulfilled in the wide open spaces or craggy mountains of an untamed land.<br>&nbsp;<br>Though this image is well founded, both of us find it one dimensional and incomplete. Little is said by historians or novelists about the role played by gallant, resourceful women in settling the West.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this new series, Hannah of Fort Bridger, we will give men their due, but our intent is to show our readers the truth of women&#x2019;s contributions in forming this nation&#x2019;s vast land west of the wide Missouri.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we present this second book in the series, let us follow valiant Hannah Cooper, whose faith in the Lord has been severely tested by the sudden death of her husband, Solomon,<br>in central Wyoming.<br>&nbsp;<br>The California-bound wagon train in which Hannah and her four children are traveling as far as Fort Bridger, Wyoming, is still some two hundred miles from the fort. It has been nearly four months since they left their home in Independence, Missouri, to begin this venture westward. On the day they pulled out of Independence, their dreams were yet to be fulfilled&#x2014;as Solomon had put it&#x2014;<i>&#x201c;out there under the distant sky.&#x201d;</i> As the wagon train pulls away from Solomon Cooper&#x2019;s grave, will Hannah&#x2019;s faith sustain her? Only the Lord knows what dangers and trials lie ahead on the trail. And when they arrive at Fort Bridger, how will she cope with the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in her path? <br>&nbsp;<br>Will she be able to handle the task of running Cooper&#x2019;s General Store without her husband? Especially since she&#x2019;s carrying their fifth child in her womb?<br>&nbsp;<br>Our heart&#x2019;s desire in presenting this book and the ones that follow in the series is to encourage our Christian readers to more fully trust the Lord as they walk life&#x2019;s pathway. And for those readers who have never opened their hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation and forgiveness of their sins, our prayer is that they might do so.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Chapter One</b><br>At high noon, the California-bound wagon train was still camped on Wyoming&#x2019;s Sweetwater River, just west of where the water roared through a narrow boulder strewn<br>section known as Devil&#x2019;s Gate.<br>&nbsp;<br>Stuart Armstrong reached out to help Hannah Cooper climb onto the wagon seat, but she turned to look over her shoulder one last time at the freshly mounded grave. As usual, the wagon train had stopped at dusk the previous night to make camp. After such an oppressively hot day, the Coopers had decided the whole family would sleep outside<br>beneath the wagon. The children fell asleep quickly, but Solomon and Hannah lay awake in each other&#x2019;s arms for quite some time, talking softly.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the dark hours of the night, Solomon awakened to a sensation of movement against his bare arm and heard a slight rattling sound. It took only seconds to realize that a rattlesnake had slithered next to him, yet he couldn&#x2019;t see where the head was.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even the slightest movement would cause the snake to strike. If any of his family stirred in their sleep...Solomon swung his arm toward the snake in the darkness and felt the sting of the rattler&#x2019;s bite. The snake bit him twice more before he got to his feet and managed to kill it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah had a few precious minutes with Sol before he was gone, but it was enough time for him to urge her to fulfill their dream and go on to Fort Bridger.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ezra&#x2019;s about ready to go, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Stuart took her hand and helped her onto the wagon seat, then climbed up and grasped the reins.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah looked at this kind man, her eyes red and swollen from a night of weeping. &#x201c;Thank you for offering to drive, Stuart. I should be feeling up to it in a couple of days.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my privilege, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He and his wife, Tracie, had traveled to Independence, Missouri, from Toledo, Ohio, to join Ezra Comstock&#x2019;s wagon train. On the trail, Solomon Cooper witnessed to Stuart and led him to Christ. Tracie, who was now driving the Armstrong wagon by herself, had come to the Lord through conversations with Hannah.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the Cooper wagon took its position in line, fourteen year-old Christopher Cooper mounted his bay gelding, Buster, and drew up beside the wagon. His dad&#x2019;s horse, Nipper, trailed behind, tied to the tailgate.<br>&nbsp;<br>Little five-year-old Patty Ruth Cooper sat between her mother and Stuart, holding tightly to her stuffed bear, Tony, named for Tony Cuzak, who drove one of the Cooper&#x2019;s four<br>supply wagons.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the back of the wagon were Hannah&#x2019;s other two children, twelve-year-old Mary Beth, and eight-year-old B. J. (short for Brett Jonathan), and the family&#x2019;s black and white rat terrier, Biggie.<br>&nbsp;<br>As he waited for all the wagons to line up, wagon master Ezra Comstock swung into his saddle at the front of the line and talked to his nephew, Micah, who drove the lead wagon. Hannah thought back to Ezra&#x2019;s words that morning. Just after the burial, he came to her and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d really like to see you go on to Fort Bridger, but not too far along the trail we&#x2019;ll come upon a supply train headin&#x2019; back east. If you wish to join it, I&#x2019;ll make arrangements for you.&#x201d; Then he left her alone beside the grave.<br>&nbsp;<br>She knelt and prayed, asking God to show her what to do. She was aware that her children were standing some distance away, watching her. They wanted to go on, but knew the decision belonged to her alone.<br>&nbsp;<br>The words of Isaiah 26:3 came to mind, and soon her heart flooded with peace as she kept her mind stayed on Jesus. Yes, they would go on to Fort Bridger and make a new life there.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, as she waited for the wagon master&#x2019;s familiar call to head out, she felt that same God-given peace even in the midst of overwhelming grief. Ezra looked back along the line of wagons to make sure they were all in position, then raised up in his stirrups and gestured west, shouting, &#x201c;Wagons, ho-o-o!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Cooper family wagon was ninth in line, with their four supply wagons directly behind and more wagons trailing them. As the wheels began to turn, Hannah twisted on the seat and leaned out. Tears came as she took one last look at her beloved Solomon&#x2019;s grave. Her grief was so new and deep that she felt as though the breath had been taken from her. Through quivering lips, she whispered, &#x201c;O dear Lord, I need the grace<br>and strength right now that only You can give.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Solomon&#x2019;s grave seemed so lonely there, under the trees. She knew he was in heaven, but still, with each step of the oxen and each turn of the wagon wheels, Hannah felt herself<br>moving farther and farther from the one who had been the essence of life to her for so many years. Her aching heart bid him good-bye with the knowledge that one day they would share a glorious reunion in God&#x2019;s bright heaven.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the grave passed from view, she sat up straight on the wagon seat and looked toward the western horizon. Twenty days to Fort Bridger, she thought, and many tomorrows. Abruptly, her own words, spoken earlier on the trail, came back<br>to her: <i>The Lord always knows what&#x2019;s ahead of us and can prepare us for the trials and heartaches that come our way, even before they happen. He&#x2019;s already in eternity, which means He&#x2019;s already in the future. So, He&#x2019;s already in our tomorrows.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;Thank You, Lord,&#x201d; she said under her breath. &#x201c;Thank You for that wonderful truth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The wagon rocked and swayed as Hannah lifted her gaze to the magnificent canopy of sky. As she studied the blue horizon, Solomon&#x2019;s words before they left Independence filled her with hope. &#x201c;Out there, Hannah, under the distant sky, is our new home and our new life.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She felt a small hand press firmly on her shoulder and turned to see Mary Beth&#x2019;s compassionate eyes. Tears were streaming down her cheeks. She smiled through her own tears and reached up to squeeze her young daughter&#x2019;s hand. Mary Beth drew in a shuddering breath and half-whispered, &#x201c;I love you, Mama.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I love you, too, sweetie.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>B. J., who was holding on to Biggie, turned to look back at his father&#x2019;s grave and started to sob. Mary Beth wiped at her own tears and swung around to put an arm around her little brother.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah glanced at Chris riding beside her on Buster, wondering how he was holding up. His eyes looked straight ahead, but his lower lip gave him away. She&#x2019;d seen him hip<br>around in the saddle as the wagons began to roll and take a last look at his father&#x2019;s grave. But Chris had wept the least of any of her children. Hannah knew he was trying to show his mother that she could depend on him, for he was now the &#x201c;man of the family.&#x201d; Her shattered heart glowed with warmth toward her courageous teenage son.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were no shadows as the sun&#x2019;s burning rays scalded the rugged land and the temperature climbed higher and higher. Hannah dabbed at her forehead and turned her gaze to the majestic mountain peaks. She hoped it would be cooler when they reached the base of the mountains and started over South Pass. The Rocky Mountains&#x2014;where the wind blew free and the eagles ruled the skies. At least that was what Hannah had once<br>read about this mountain range.<br>&nbsp;<br>Twenty more days, she thought. If all went as Ezra planned, they would arrive in Fort Bridger on September 17. School, no doubt, would start in early September. She hoped<br>her children wouldn&#x2019;t find it too difficult to catch up with their studies.<br>&nbsp;<br>Patty Ruth looked up at Hannah with a sheen of moisture covering her face. &#x201c;Mama, I&#x2019;m thirsty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah half-turned to reach for the canteen, but Mary Beth, who rode directly behind her, had already lifted it from a small table and now offered it to her. She thanked her oldest daughter and helped the little redhead take her fill. Patty Ruth smacked her lips and burped slightly. &#x201c;&#x2019;Scuse me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, I should hope so,&#x201d; Hannah said, smiling, and capped the canteen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Stuart chuckled. &#x201c;Mrs. Cooper, I want to commend you for the way you and Mr. Cooper have brought up your children. They&#x2019;re so mannerly and polite. I hope that when Tracie<br>and I have children, they&#x2019;ll be just like yours.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a wonderful compliment, Stuart,&#x201d; she said, pride in her children welling up in her heart. She thought of the new little life she was carrying. A lump rose in<br>her throat when she realized it was just last night that she&#x2019;d informed Solomon they were going to have a fifth child. He could hardly contain his excitement.<br>&nbsp;<br>She touched her midsection and told herself she would wait to tell the children about the baby until just before it started to show. She looked down at Patty Ruth, who watched her, and cupped a hand under her chubby little chin.<br>&nbsp;<br>Patty Ruth blinked earnestly and said, &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t cry, Mama. Papa&#x2019;s lookin&#x2019; down from heaven, an&#x2019; he wouldn&#x2019; want you to cry.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying not to, honey. Oh, I love you so much!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I love you so much, too, Mama.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And so do we,&#x201d; spoke up B. J. from behind. &#x201c;Even Biggie loves you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And so does Tony the Bear, Mama,&#x201d; said Patty Ruth, lifting up the stuffed animal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mary Beth didn&#x2019;t say anything, but she put her hand on her mother&#x2019;s shoulder and squeezed gently.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best mother in all the world, Mama,&#x201d; Chris said. &#x201c;The Lord sure blessed us when He made us your children.&#x201d; Hannah began to cry all over again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even Stuart Armstrong could feel some moisture welling up in his eyes, and he turned his head so they couldn&#x2019;t see. As the wagons continued on the journey and the dust boiled up in clouds, Hannah&#x2019;s mind went back to her parents. Ben and Esther Singleton had refused to go along with Hannah and Solomon to Fort Bridger. They would not budge from their<br>home in Independence. They fought the &#x201c;foolish&#x201d; idea of Hannah and Solomon taking their grandchildren and moving to the Wild West.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah swallowed hard as she recalled her father&#x2019;s harsh words: <i>If you loved us, you wouldn&#x2019;t be so eager to go off and leave us! I&#x2019;m telling both of you, you&#x2019;ll be sorry you did this foolish thing. It&#x2019;ll backfire on you! You&#x2019;re making the biggest mistake of your lives!</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Two hours ago, when Hannah knelt beside Solomon&#x2019;s grave, she told herself that her father was right. She and Solomon had misunderstood what they thought was God&#x2019;s<br>leading and had made a horrible mistake. For a moment she had actually thought that Solomon&#x2019;s untimely death was the backfire her father had predicted.<br>&nbsp;<br>But then the Lord spoke to her by His still small voice in her heart, saying, <i>Hannah, if you had stayed in Independence, what about Tracie, Stuart, and Tony?</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Suddenly it had come over Hannah that none of those three would be Christians now if the Coopers hadn&#x2019;t been in the wagon train. They&#x2019;re going to heaven because we followed God&#x2019;s leadership and struck out for Fort Bridger!<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, she and Solomon had done the right thing! It was all in God&#x2019;s perfect plan, even Solomon&#x2019;s homegoing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even so, she felt keenly the loneliness. She had leaned so much on Solomon; loved him so much, and now he was gone. Her throat tightened. Thank the Lord she still had her four children...and the new baby was a special gift from God. She would have this part of her darling Sol to carry with her to their new home.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hannah noticed Chris pull up on Buster&#x2019;s reins and let the wagon move on, then he fell in beside the first Cooper supply wagon and started talking to Tony Cuzak. Tony&#x2019;s plan had been to go to California, but when the wagon train had stopped at the Kline ranch, he had fallen in love with young widow Amanda Kline. After driving the Cooper supply wagon to Fort Bridger, Tony planned to go back to court Amanda. Tony. Hannah smiled to herself. Though Tony was young in the Lord, he had shown much spiritual growth since his conversion.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the graveside this morning, he had approached Hannah and asked if he could read Scripture and say a few words over Solomon&#x2019;s blanket-wrapped body before it was lowered into the grave. Hannah was pleased to give her permission. Tony&#x2019;s touching words ran through her mind: <i>Solomon Cooper was a brave man. Not only did he show valor on the battlefield in the War, but he demonstrated unparalleled courage and heroism by taking the venom of the rattler in order to protect his family. He knew he would probably lose his life in the process. He loved his dear wife, Hannah; his dear daughters, Mary Beth and Patty Ruth; and his dea...</i></p><h2>Scrappy Little Nobody - Signed / Autographed Copy</h2><p>`Fearsome wit&#39; Elle`Charming&#39; Buzzfeed`Ridiculously entertaining&#39; Associated Press`Endearingly honest&#39; Guardian A collection of humorous autobiographical essays by the Academy Award-nominated actress and star of Pitch Perfect, Twilight, Up in the Air, Into the Woods and Trolls. Even before she made a name for herself on the silver screen, Anna Kendrick was unusually small, weird, defiant, and `10 per cent weird&#39;. When she was thirteen, a classmate dropped by her house unexpectedly and discovered written evidence of Anna&#39;s social ineptitude.

With her razor-sharp wit, Anna recounts the absurdities she&#39;s experienced on her way to and from the heart of pop culture as only she can - from her unusual path to the performing arts (her older brother&#39;s affinity for Vanilla Ice may have inadvertently launched her career) to her double life as a middle-school student who also starred on Broadway to her initial `dating experiments&#39; (including only liking boys who didn&#39;t like her back) to the perils of reading The Shining while filming Twilight in the isolated Canadian wilderness to reviewing a binder full of butt doubles to her struggle to live like an adult woman instead of a perpetual `man-child&#39;. Enter Anna&#39;s world and follow her rise from `scrappy little nobody&#39; to someone who dazzles on the stage, the screen, and now the page - with an electric, singular voice, at once familiar and surprising, sharp and sweet, funny and serious (well, not that serious).</p><p>Born and raised in Portland, Maine, Anna Kendrick made her Broadway debut at the age of twelve in her Tony-nominated performance for the musical High Society.

In 1856, just days before his 15th birthday, Daniel fulfilled a lifelong dream and set sail on a whaling ship. In concise, evocative prose, Stanley explains that the trip quickly became nightmarish: no whales are spotted for 10 months and?far worse?the cruel and violent captain displays a particular dislike for Daniel. When the tyrant refuses to release the boy from service, Daniel begins to plot his escape, and seizes his chance one cold night in Siberia. There, injured from the captain's beatings, he survives an eight-month-long winter, complete with attacks by bears and wolves. Finally, in a heartwarming passage that has all the drama of fiction, Daniel spots a whaling ship as it lowers a boat to fetch him. Stanley illuminates the lives of 19th-century whalers while vividly portraying her protagonist. Although it is not as thoroughly stunning as her work in Cleopatra and Bard of Avon, her meticulous art?here rendered in pastels on sanded paper?is steeped in period detail and abounds with energy. Ages 6-9. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3-5?Using an 1861 autobiographical work by Hall called Arctic Rovings, Stanley has provided modern readers with a brief look at an exciting, true adventure. Rejecting a clerking career, Daniel, 14, signed on a New Bedford, MA, whaling ship for a perilous three-year voyage. Though accepting of hard work and uncomfortable conditions, the teen innocently incurred his captain's ill will. Suffering mental and physical abuse, he and a young companion deserted on the bleak Siberian shore, where they endured a brutal winter and were aided by inmates of a prison colony. They were rescued in the spring and Daniel was eventually reunited with his widower father. An afterword completes what is known about Hall's later life. Dramatic pastel illustrations complement the composed text, giving young readers visual images of towering masts, snarling wolf packs, and harpooned whales spouting blood. The large format may prove a tad off-putting to some older readers who would truly be amazed at Daniel's adventures, but should please youngsters looking for a nifty piece of nonfiction to whet their imaginations.?Patricia Manning, Eastchester Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sabbatica</h2><p>SABBATICA The Seas Of Death And The Arcana Of Deathbringer The first in a series of grimoires, Sabbatica emerges as an exposition of spectral seals, opening the astral paths of sorcery and magick.

They argue that such crises have been used to support political objectives of state expansion and control in the uplands. They have also been used to justify the alternative directions advocated by an array of NGOs.<br><br>In official and alternative discourses of economic development, the peoples living in Thailand's hill country are typically cast as either guardians or destroyers of forest resources, often depending on their ethnicity. Political and historical factors have created a simplistic, misleading, and often scientifically inaccurate environmental narrative: Hmong farmers, for example, are thought to exhibit environmentally destructive practices, whereas the Karen are seen as linked to and protective of their ancestral home. Forsyth and Walker reveal a much more complex relationship of hill farmers to the land, to other ethnic groups, and to the state. They conclude that current explanations fail to address the real causes of environmental problems and unnecessarily restrict the livelihoods of local people.<br><br>The authors' critical assessment of simplistic environmental narratives, as well as their suggestions for finding solutions, will be valuable in international policy discussions about environmental issues in rapidly developing countries. Moreover, their redefinition of northern Thailand's environmental problems, and their analysis of how political influences have reinforced inappropriate policies, demonstrate new ways of analyzing how environmental science and knowledge are important arenas for political control.<br><br>This book makes valuable contributions to Thai studies and more generally to the fields of environmental science, ecology, geography, anthropology, and political science, as well as to policy making and resource management in the developing world.</p><p><p>Challenges assumptions about the causes of "environmental degradation."</p>"<i>Forest Guardians, Forest Destroyers</i> succeeds in casting serious doubts on the accuracy of received ideas about the nature and dynamics of environmental change. It has important policy implications because land use regulations in Thailand appear to be based on a misunderstanding of the causes of environmental problems." - Thomas J. Bassett, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <p> "The fact that northern Thailand has been studied closely by many scholars, including the authors, makes possible a rich and original synthesis. Since the region served as a buffer zone during the Cold War period, this study illuminates key processes across geographic scales in Thailand and, by comparison, in other such crucial border areas. The authors' impressive theoretical compass combines effectively with deep regional knowledge to provide a study that should spark vigorous debate about the politics of knowledge and environment." - K.

His assassination in November 1995 at the hands of a right-wing Jewish radical shocked the world and changed the face of Middle Eastern politics overnight. But whatever the public view of Rabin might have been, no one else had the perspective that many years of marriage gave his wife. In <i>Rabin: Our Life, His Legacy</i>, Leah Rabin shares her memories of the public figure and the private man. <p> It soon becomes evident that Rabin is a woman with strong preferences and opinions. She found Rosalyn Carter difficult to deal with and developed a fondness for Yasir Arafat. She has no doubt that her husband's assassination was the result of hate-mongering among right-wing rabbis and intellectuals based at Bar-Ilan University, where Yigal Amir, Rabin's killer, was a student. Leah Rabin may not have written the most objective biography of the late prime minister, but certainly <i>Rabin</i> is intimate and heartfelt and full of timely reflections on Israel's past and future.</p>These partisan and occasionally gushy witness-to-history memoirs by the wife of the slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin are read by English actress Claire Bloom with sidebars in the author&#39;s voice. Jewish listeners may squirm at some of Bloom&#39;s pronunciations of Hebrew words--as in &#34;EAT-sack&#34; for the name of the title character. Otherwise an excellent reader with a beautiful voice, she lends this book appropriate dignity. The tape inadvertently reveals much that the printed book does not about the personality and mind-set of the author. In serving this function, the recording becomes a valuable tool for anyone wishing to understand the turmoil in the Middle East. Y.R.

Anything else?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Small column of men.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Soldiers?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Hardly.&#x2019; The sentry grimaced. &#x2018;Unless there&#x2019;s been some change in marching drill.&#x2019; <br>The duty centurion glanced up sharply. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t recall asking for an opinion on policy, soldier.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;No, sir!&#x2019; The sentry snapped to attention under the glare of his superior. Only a few months earlier Lucius Cornelius Macro had been an optio and was still finding promotion to the centurionate hard to handle. His former comrades in the ranks were still inclined to treat him as an equal. It was hard to register a respectful attitude to one who so recently had been seen emptying his guts of a skinful of cheap wine. But, for some months before the promotion, Macro had been aware that senior officers were considering him for the first available vacancy in the centurionate and had done his best to keep indiscretions to a minimum. For, when all his qualities were placed in the balance, Macro was a good soldier &#x2013; when good soldiering was required &#x2013; conscientious in his duties, reliably obedient to orders and he could be counted on to hold firm in a fight and inspire others to do the same. <br>Macro suddenly realised that he had been gazing at the sentry for a while and that the legionary was shifting uncomfortably under his scrutiny, as one tends to in front of a silently staring superior. And officers could be such unpredictable bastards, the sentry thought nervously, first whiff of power and they either don&#x2019;t know what to do with it, or they insist on giving bloody-minded and stupid orders. <br>&#x2018;What are your orders, sir?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Orders?&#x2019; Macro frowned for a moment. &#x2018;All right then. I&#x2019;ll come. You get back to the gate.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Yes, sir.&#x2019; The sentry turned and hurriedly made his way out of the junior officers&#x2019; latrine block, pulling the door to as the half-dozen centurions glared after him. It was an unwritten rule that no-one, but no-one, permitted their men to interrupt proceedings in the latrine. Macro applied the sponge stick, pulled up his breeches and apologised to the other centurions before hurrying outside. <br>It was a filthy night and a cold northerly wind was blowing the rain down from the German forests. It swept across the Rhine, over the fortress walls and was funnelled into icy blasts between the barrack blocks. Macro suspected that he was keenly disapproved of by his new-found peers and was determined to prove them wrong. Not that this resolution was working out terribly successfully. The administrative duties relating to the command of eighty men were proving to be a nightmare &#x2013; ration-collection details, latrine rotas, sentry rotas, weapons inspections, barrack inspections, punishment ledgers, equipment procurement chits, arranging fodder for the section mules, taking charge of pay, savings and the funeral club. <br>The only help available for carrying out these duties came in the form of the century&#x2019;s clerk, a wizened old cove named Piso, who Macro suspected of being dishonest or simply incompetent. Macro had no way of finding out for himself, because he was all but illiterate. Brought up with only the most rudimentary knowledge of letters and numbers he could recognise most individually, but more than that was impossible. And now he was a centurion, a rank for whom literacy was a prerequisite. Doubtless the legate had naturally assumed Macro could read and write when he approved the appointment. If it came to light that he was no more literate than a Campanian farm boy, Macro knew he would be demoted at once. So far he had managed to get round the problem by delegating the paperwork to Piso and claiming that his other duties were keeping him too busy, but he was sure that the clerk had begun to suspect the truth. He shook his head as he trudged over to the fortress gate, pulling his red cloak tightly about him. <br>It was a dark night, made darker by the low clouds that completely obscured the sky; a sure sign that snow was on the way. From the gloom about him, Macro could hear a variety of sounds typical of the fortress existence that had been part of his life for over twelve years now. Mules brayed from stables at the far end of each barrack block and the voices of soldiers, talking and shouting, drifted out through the wavering light of candlelit windows. A bellow of laughter peeled out of a barrack block he was passing, followed by a lighter, female laugh. Macro halted mid-stride and listened. Someone had managed to sneak a woman into the base. The woman laughed again and then began speaking in thickly accented Latin and was quickly hushed by her companion. This was a flagrant breach of regulations and Macro abruptly turned towards the block and laid his hand on the latch. Then paused, thinking. By rights he should burst in, loudly bellowing in parade-ground fashion, send the soldier to the guard-house, and have the woman thrown out of the base. But that meant completing an entry in the punishment book &#x2013; more bloody writing. <br>Gritting his teeth, Macro released his grip and quietly stepped back into the street, just as the woman let out a shriek of laughter to prick his conscience. A quick glance about to make sure that no-one else was there to witness his failure to act and Macro hurried on towards the south gate. Bloody soldier deserved a good kicking, and if he had been in Macro&#x2019;s century that&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;d have been dealt with; no paperwork needed, just a swift kick in the balls to ensure the punishment fitted the crime. Still, from her voice she could only have been one of those nasty German tarts from the native settlement that sprawled just outside the base. Macro consoled himself with the thought of the legionary concerned coming down with a bad dose of the clap. <br>Although the streets were dark, Macro moved instinctively in the right direction since no legionary base deviated from the standard design used in all camps and fortresses. In a matter of minutes, he had emerged on to the wider thoroughfare of the Via Praetoria and marched towards the gate where the street passed through the walls to the south of the base. The sentry who had interrupted Macro at the latrine was waiting at the foot of the stairs. He led the way into the gatehouse and up the narrow wooden staircase to the battlement level, where a lit brazier cast a warm red glow around the sentry room. Four legionaries were squatting close to the fire playing dice. As soon as they saw the centurion&#x2019;s head appear above the stairs they stood to attention. <br>&#x2018;Easy lads,&#x2019; Macro said. &#x2018;Carry on.&#x2019; <br>The wooden door to the battlements sprang inwards with the wind as Macro lifted the latch and the brazier blazed momentarily as he stepped outside and slammed the door to. Up on the sentry walk the wind was biting and whipped Macro&#x2019;s cloak behind him, tugging at the clasp on his left shoulder. He shuddered and snatched it back, holding it tightly about his body. <br>&#x2018;Where?&#x2019; <br>The sentry peered out through the crenellations into the darkness and pointed his javelin at a tiny flickering light swinging from the back of a wagon approaching from the south. Straining his eyes as he stared into the wind, Macro could make out the outline of the wagon and, behind it, a body of men plodding along the track. At the rear of the column came the more orderly progress of the escort whose job was to stop the stragglers slowing the pace. Maybe two hundred men in all. <br>&#x2018;Shall I call out the guard, sir?&#x2019; <br>Macro turned towards the sentry. &#x2018;What did you say?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Shall I call out the guard, sir?&#x2019; <br>Macro eyed the man wearily. Syrus was one of the youngest men in the century and, although Macro had learned the names of most of his command, he knew little of their characters or histories as yet. &#x2018;Been in the army long?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;No, sir. Only a year in December.&#x2019; <br>Not long out of training then, Macro thought. A stickler for regulations, which he no doubt applied in every circumstance. He&#x2019;d learn in time; how to compromise between following strict procedure and doing what was needed to get by. <br>&#x2018;So then, why do we need to call out the guard?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Regulations, sir. If an unidentified body of men is approaching the camp in force the guard century should be called out to man the gate and adjacent walls.&#x2019; <br>Macro raised his eyebrows in surprise. The quotation was word perfect. Syrus clearly took his training seriously. &#x2018;And what then?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Sir?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;What happens next?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;The duty centurion, after assessing the situation determines whether or not to call a general alarm,&#x2019; Syrus continued tonelessly, then hurriedly added, &#x2018;Sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Good man.&#x2019; Macro smiled and the sentry smiled back in relief, before Macro turned back towards the approaching column. &#x2018;Now then, exactly how threatening do you think that lot is? Do they scare you, soldier? Do you think all two hundred of them are going to charge over here, climb the walls and slaughter every mother&#x2019;s son of the Second Legion . . . Well, do you?&#x2019; <br>The sentry looked at Macro, looked carefully at the flickering lights for a new moments and then turned back sheepishly. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think so, sir,&#x2019; said Macro gruffly as he punched the lad on the shoulder. <br>&#x2018;Sorry, sir.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Tell me, Syrus. Did you attend the sentry briefing before the watch?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Of course, sir.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Did you pay attention to every detail?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I think so, sir.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Then you would recall me saying that a replacement convoy was due to arrive at the base, wouldn&#x2019;t you?

In this globally minded import, traditional <i>kalamkari </i>textiles from India illustrate a charming Indonesian folktale. Well suited to adaptation for student storytelling, the tale features a conflict between a clever deer and a greedy monkey, whose plan to grow and share their favorite fruits humorously backfires. The textiles' muted dyes and an art style that fuses decorative and narrative impulses mark a striking departure from most picture-book illustrations but will easily support discussions about diverse storytelling approaches or multicultural crafts--perhaps alongside the Egyptian tapestries in Denys Johnston-Davies' <i>Goha the Wise Fool </i>(2005).

He follows me everywhere since the funeral, a long line of black I can&#x2019;t shake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, he sleeps on the end of my bed or in the doorway of my room, but for the last two nights he&#x2019;s slept in front of my packed suitcases. I can&#x2019;t take him with me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an ocean dog.&#x201d; I run my finger along his nose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d go mad in the city.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There&#x2019;s no sleeping after dreams of Cal, so I pull on clothes and climb out the window. The moon is three--quarters empty. The air is as hot as day. I mowed late yesterday, so I collect warm blades of grass on the soles of my feet as I move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Woof and I get to the beach quickly. There&#x2019;s almost nothing between our house and the water. There&#x2019;s the road, a small stretch of scrub, and then dunes. The night is all tangle and smell. Salt and tree; smoke from a fire far up the beach. It&#x2019;s all memory, too. Summer swimming and night walks, hunts for fig shells and blennies and starfish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Farther, toward the lighthouse, there&#x2019;s the spot where the beaked whale washed ashore: a giant at six meters, the right side of its face pressed against sand, its one visible eye open. There was a crowd of people around it later&#x2014;-scientists and locals studying and staring. But first there was Mum and Cal and me in the early cold. I was nine years old, and with its long beak it looked to me like it was half sea creature, half bird. I wanted to study the deep water it had come from, the things it might have seen. Cal and I spent the day looking through Mum&#x2019;s books and on the internet. The beaked whale is considered one of the least understood creatures of the sea, I copied into my journal. They live at depths so deep that the pressure could kill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts or past lives or time travel or any of&nbsp;the strange things that Cal liked to read about. But every time I stand on the beach, I wish us back&#x2014;-to the day of the whale, to&nbsp;any day before Cal died. With what I know, I&#x2019;d be ready. I&#x2019;d save him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s late, but there&#x2019;ll be people from school out, so I walk farther up to a quiet spot. I dig myself into the dunes, burying my legs past my hips, and stare at the water. It&#x2019;s shot with moon, silver leaking all over the surface.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve tried and tried to stop thinking about the day Cal drowned, but I can&#x2019;t. I hear his words. I hear his footsteps through the sand. I see him diving: a long, frail arc that disappears into sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure how long I&#x2019;ve been here when I see Mum walking over the dunes, her feet struggling to find traction. She sits on one side of me and lights a cigarette, cupping it from the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She started smoking again after Cal died. I found her and Dad hiding behind the church after the funeral. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say it, Rach,&#x201d; she said, and I stood between them and held their free hands, wishing Cal had been there to see the strangeness of our parents smoking. Dad&#x2019;s a doctor; he&#x2019;s been working with Doctors Without Borders since the divorce ten years ago. Mum&#x2019;s a science teacher at the high school in Sea Ridge. They&#x2019;ve called cigarettes &#x201c;death sticks&#x201d; all our lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We watch the water without talking for a while. I don&#x2019;t know how Mum feels about the ocean now. She doesn&#x2019;t go in anymore, but we meet at the edge every night. She taught Cal and me how to swim, how to cup water, how to push it back and control its flow. She told us not to be afraid. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever swim alone, though,&#x201d; she said, and apart from that one time, we didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re packed?&#x201d; Mum asks, and I nod.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tomorrow I leave Sea Ridge for Gracetown, a suburb of Melbourne, the city where my aunt Rose lives. I&#x2019;ve failed Year 12, and since I don&#x2019;t plan to try again next year, Rose has gotten me a job in the caf� at St. Albert&#x2019;s Hospital, where she&#x2019;s a doctor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cal and I grew up in Gracetown. We moved to Sea Ridge three years ago, when I was fifteen. Gran needed help, and we didn&#x2019;t want her to sell the house or go into a home. We&#x2019;d stayed with her every holiday, summer and winter, since we were born, so Sea Ridge was like our second home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Year 12 isn&#x2019;t everything,&#x201d; Mum says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it&#x2019;s not, but before Cal died, I had my life planned. I got A&#x2019;s, I was happy. I sat on this exact spot last year and told Cal I wanted to be an ichthyologist, studying fish like the Chimaera, which evolved 400 million years ago. We both tried to imagine a world that went that far back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I feel like the universe cheated Cal and cheated us along with him,&#x201d; I say now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before Cal died, Mum would have explained calmly and logically that the universe was all existing matter and space&#x2014;-10 billion light--years in diameter, consisting of galaxies and the solar system, stars, and the planets. All of which simply do not have the capacity to cheat a person of anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight she lights another cigarette. &#x201c;It did,&#x201d; she says, and blows smoke at the stars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Henry</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m lying next to Amy in the self--help section of Howling Books. We&#x2019;re alone. It&#x2019;s ten on Thursday night and I&#x2019;ll be honest: I&#x2019;m currently mismanaging a hard--on. The mismanagement isn&#x2019;t entirely my fault. My body&#x2019;s working on muscle memory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, this is the time and place that Amy and I kiss. This is the time our hearts breathe hard and she lies next to me, warm--skinned and funny, making jokes about the state of my hair. It&#x2019;s the time we talk about the future, which was, if you&#x2019;d asked me fifteen minutes ago, completely bought and paid for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I want to break up,&#x201d; she says, and at first I think she&#x2019;s joking. Less than twelve hours ago, we were kissing in this exact spot. We were doing quite a few other very nice things too, I think, as she elbows me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Henry?&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Say something.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Say what?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Whatever you&#x2019;re thinking.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking this is entirely unexpected and a little bit shit.&#x201d; I struggle into an upright position. &#x201c;We bought plane tickets. Nonrefundable, nonexchangeable plane tickets for the twelfth of March.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, Henry,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We leave in ten weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; she says, as though I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s sounding unreasonable. Maybe I am sounding unreasonable, but that&#x2019;s because I spent the last dollar of my savings buying a six--stop--around--the--world ticket. Singapore, Berlin, Rome, London, Helsinki, New York. &#x201c;We bought travel insurance and got our passports. We bought travel guides and those little blow pillows for the plane.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She bites the right side of her lip, and I try very hard, unsuccessfully, not to think about kissing her. &#x201c;You said you loved me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I do love you,&#x201d; Amy says, and then she starts italicizing love into all its depressing definitions. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m in love with you. I tried, though. I tried really hard.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These must be the most depressing words in the history of love. I tried really hard to love you. I&#x2019;m not certain of a lot of things, but I&#x2019;m certain of this&#x2014;-when I&#x2019;m old and I have dementia, when my brain has aged to smoke, these are words I will remember.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I should ask her to leave. I should say, &#x201c;You know what? I don&#x2019;t want to see the homelands of William Shakespeare and Mary Shelley and Friedrich Nietzsche and Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson and Karen Russell with a girl who&#x2019;s trying very hard to love me.&#x201d; I should say, &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t love me, then I don&#x2019;t love you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But fuck it I do love her and I would like to see those homelands with her and I&#x2019;m an optimist without a whole lot of dignity, so what I say is &#x201c;If you change your mind, you know where I live.&#x201d; In my defense she&#x2019;s crying and we&#x2019;ve been friends since Year 9 and in my book that counts for a lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There&#x2019;s no other way for her to leave but to climb over me, because the self--help section is in a small room at the back of the shop that most people think is a closet, but it&#x2019;s just big enough for two people to lie side by side with no space to spare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do this weird fumbling dance as she gets up, a soft un-tangling wrestle. We kiss before she goes. It&#x2019;s a long kiss, a good kiss, and while it&#x2019;s happening I let myself hope that maybe, just maybe, it&#x2019;s so great that it&#x2019;s changed her mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But after it&#x2019;s done, she stands and straightens her skirt and gives me a small, sad wave. And then she leaves me here, lying on the floor of the self--help section&#x2014;-a dead man. One with a non-refundable, nonexchangeable ticket to the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually I crawl out of the self--help section and make my way to the fiction couch: the long blue velvet daybed that sits in front of the classics shelves. I rarely sleep upstairs anymore. I like the rustle and dust of the bookshop at night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I lie here thinking about Amy. I retrace last week, running back through the hours, trying to work out what changed between us. But I&#x2019;m the same person I was seven days ago. I&#x2019;m the same person I was the week before and the week before that. I&#x2019;m the same person I was all the way back to the morning we met.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amy came from a private school across the river and moved to our side of town when her dad&#x2019;s accounting firm downsized and he had to shift jobs. They lived in one of the new apartments that had gone up on Green Street, not far from the school. From Amy&#x2019;s new bedroom, she could hear traffic and the flush of next--door&#x2019;s toilet. From her old bedroom, she could hear birds. These things I learned before we dated, in snippets of conversations that happened on the way home from parties, in English, in detention, in the library, when she stopped by the bookshop on Sunday afternoons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first day I met her I knew surface things&#x2014;-she had long red hair, green eyes, and fair skin. She smelled flowery. She wore long socks. She sat at an empty table and waited for people to sit next to her. They did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat in front and listened to the conversation between her and Aaliyah. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I heard Amy ask. &#x201c;Henry,&#x201d; Aaliyah told her. &#x201c;Funny. Smart. Cute.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I waved above my head at them, without turning around.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;An eavesdropper,&#x201d; Amy added, gently kicking the back of my chair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We didn&#x2019;t officially get together till the middle of Year 12, but the first time we kissed was in Year 9. It happened after our English class had been studying Ray Bradbury&#x2019;s short stories. After we read &#x201c;The Last Night of the World,&#x201d; the idea caught on that we should all spend a night pretending it was our last and do the things we&#x2019;d do if an apocalypse was heading our way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our English teacher heard what we were planning, and the principal told us we couldn&#x2019;t do it. It sounded dangerous. Our plans went underground. Flyers appeared in lockers that the date was set for the twelfth of December, the last day of school before summer vacation. There&#x2019;d be a party that night at Justin Kent&#x2019;s house. make plans, the flyers told us. the end is near.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stayed up late on the night before the end, trying to write the perfect letter to Amy, a letter that&#x2019;d convince her to spend her last night in the world with me. I walked into school with it in my top pocket, knowing I probably wouldn&#x2019;t give it to her but hoping that I would. My plan was to spend the last night with friends unless some miracle happened and Amy became a possibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one listened in class that day. There were small signs all over the place that things were coming to an end. In our homeroom, someone had turned all the notices on the board upside down. Someone had carved the end into the back of the boys&#x2019; toilet door. I opened my locker at lunch to find a piece of paper with one day to go written on it, and I realized that no one had bothered working out the finer details of when the world would actually end: Midnight? Sunrise?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was thinking about that when I turned and saw Amy standing next to me. The note was in my pocket, but I couldn&#x2019;t give it to her. Instead, I held up the paper&#x2014;-one day to go&#x2014;-and asked her what she was planning to do with her last night. She stared at me for a while and eventually said, &#x201c;I thought you might ask me to spend it with you.&#x201d; There were several people in the corridor listening, and all of us, me included, couldn&#x2019;t believe my luck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To give myself maximum living time, I decided that the world should end when the sun came up&#x2014;-five fifty in the morning, according to the Weather Channel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We met at the bookshop at five fifty in the afternoon to make it an even twelve hours, and from there we walked to Shanghai Dumplings for dinner. Around nine we went to Justin&#x2019;s party, and when it got too loud, we walked to the Benito Building and took the elevator to the top&#x2014;-the highest place in Gracetown.</p></p><h2>Luxury Hotels Beach Resorts</h2><p>Presents a pictorial view of a variety of luxury seaside resorts from around the world.</p><p>Sumptuously illustrated full color profiles of beach hotels ranging across continents and around the world that offer the best in style, service, and design.

Propaganda art - persuasion through visual means - is as old as man. In PROP ART, Gary Yanker examines the recent political poster as a vehicle for conveying the propaganda message. Posters, which can be duplicated on a vast scale or quickly and crudely made by hand, are the cheapest medium for the dissemination of ideas. National governments, political parties, pressure groups of all persuasions, rely on posters for much of their propaganda. Today, thanks largely to the highly visible efforts of students around the world - notably in France, Czechoslovakia, Mexico and the United States - posters have become more widespread than ever. As &#34;cult&#34; objects and as purely decorative designs they appear as frequently in living rooms as on billboards, fostering a new &#34;poster consciousness.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Saint-Germain: Memoirs</h2><p>Focusing on Saint-Germain&#x2014;one of the genre&#x2019;s most memorable vampires&#x2014;this collection follows the dark immortal from ancient Greece to the present as tales of his timeless life are recounted.

Through breathtaking cartography it vividly captures the great economic and social events that made possible the successful birth of a huge new country.</p><p>The Land Transformed reveals how a thinly populated and economically limited group of colonies in 1800 came together to become the Canada of the 1890s. The profound revolution was the transformation of the land: forest and grassland gave way to farmland, native populations were moved onto reservations, railways and telegraph tied together widely separated communities; urban commercial centres grew. At the end of the century Canada was recognizable as one of the world's major countries, stretching across a continent, comfortably at home in the world of railways, factories, and well-developed agriculture.</p><p>The first part of the volume, 'Extending the Frontier: Settlement to Mid-Century,' describes the growth of the population and the economy in the first half of the century. Maps, graphs, charts, and paintings are used with imagination and clarity to portray the spread of settlement, based on immigration and an accelerated use of resources, the most important of which was land. By the 1850s a dominant agriculture was joined to a productive timber trade as the country's engine of growth.</p><p>Part II, 'Building a Nation,' covers the country's 'coming of age.' Between the 1850s and the 1890s political union was achieved, conomic growth continued, and a recognizable Canadian society emerged. These same developments left in their wake a declining and dispersed indigenous population. A series of treaties moved Indian populations to reserves of land in a massive rearrangement of native territory that set the stage for continuing cultural conflict.</p><p>The nineteenth century witnessed the culmination of four centuries of European engagement in North America. Momentous events of the time are captured in this volume, which provides a splendid visual record of the drama of nation building and the roots of the diverse nation we know today.</p></p><p><p>'What sets the book in a class of its own is the astonishingly diverse areas that it addresses.'</p><b>R. Louis Gentilcore</b> is Professor of Geography at McMaster University in Hamilton. His research interest for many years has been in the historical geography of Canada, with particular emphasis on settlement development in eastern Canada in the nineteenth century.<p></p></p><h2>Gift of Fear</h2><p>The man whom Oprah Winfrey calls &#34;the nation&#39;s leading expert on violent behavior&#34; shows how to spot even subtle signs of danger before it&#39;s too late. Abridged. 3 CDs.</p><p>Each hour, 75 women are raped in the United States, and every few seconds, a woman is beaten. Each day, 400 Americans suffer shooting injuries, and another 1,100 face criminals armed with guns. Author Gavin de Becker says victims of violent behavior usually feel a sense of fear before any threat or violence takes place. They may distrust the fear, or it may impel them to some action that saves their lives. A leading expert on predicting violent behavior, de Becker believes we can all learn to recognize these signals of the "universal code of violence," and use them as tools to help us survive. The book teaches how to identify the warning signals of a potential attacker and recommends strategies for dealing with the problem before it becomes life threatening. The case studies are gripping and suspenseful, and include tactics for dealing with similar situations.<p> People don't just "snap" and become violent, says de Becker, whose clients include federal government agencies, celebrities, police departments, and shelters for battered women. "There is a process as observable, and often as predictable, as water coming to a boil." Learning to predict violence is the cornerstone to preventing it. De Becker is a master of the psychology of violence, and his advice may save your life. <i>--Joan Price</i> </p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Gavin de Becker</strong> <br> <p> </p> <b>Question:</b> In today&#x2019;s world, where terror and tragedy seem omnipresent, the fear of violence never seems more heightened. Is the world a more violent place than it ever has been?<p></p> <p><b>Gavin de Becker :</b> Your question contains much of the answer: today&#x2019;s world, "where terror and tragedy seem omnipresent..." The key word is "seem." When TV news coverage presents so much on these topics, it elevates the perception of terrorism and tragedy way beyond the reality. In every major city, TV news creates forty hours of original production every day, most of it composed and presented to get our attention with fear. Hence an incident on an airplane in which a man fails to do any damage is treated as if the make-shift bomb actually exploded. It didn&#x2019;t. Imagine having a near miss in your car, avoiding what would have been a serious collision--and then talking about every hour for months after the fact. Welcome to TV news.</p> <p>To the second part of your question, No, the world is not a more violent place than it has ever been, however we live as if it were. The U.S. is the most powerful nation in world history--and also the most afraid. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Your bestselling book <i>The Gift of Fear</i> gives many examples to help readers recognize what you call pre-incident indicators (PINS) of violence. What role does intuition play in recognizing these signals?</p> <p><b>Gavin de Becker:</b> Like every creature on earth, we have an extraordinary defense resource: We don&#x2019;t have the sharpest claws and strongest jaws--but we do have the biggest brains, and intuition is the most impressive process of these brains. It might be hard to accept its importance because intuition is often described as emotional, unreasonable, or inexplicable. Husbands chide their wives about "feminine intuition" and don&#x2019;t take it seriously. If intuition is used by a woman to explain some choice she made or a concern she can&#x2019;t let go of, men roll their eyes and write it off. We much prefer logic, the grounded, explainable, unemotional thought process that ends in a supportable conclusion. In fact, Americans worship logic, even when it&#x2019;s wrong, and deny intuition, even when it&#x2019;s right. Men, of course, have their own version of intuition, not so light and inconsequential, they tell themselves, as that feminine stuff. Theirs is more viscerally named a "gut feeling," but whatever name we use, it isn&#x2019;t just a feeling. It is a process more extraordinary and ultimately more logical in the natural order than the most fantastic computer calculation. It is our most complex cognitive process and, at the same time, the simplest.</p> <p>Intuition connects us to the natural world and to our nature. It carries us to predictions we will later marvel at. "Somehow I knew," we will say about the chance meeting we predicted, or about the unexpected phone call from a distant friend, or the unlikely turnaround in someone&#x2019;s behavior, or about the violence we steered clear of, or, too often, the violence we elected not to steer clear of. <i>The Gift of Fear</i> offers strategies that help us recognize the signals of intuition--and helps us avoid denial, which is the enemy of safety. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Your latest book, <i>Just 2 Seconds</i>, has been called a "masterpiece" of analysis on the art of preventing assassination. It contains an entire compendium of attacks on protected persons across the globe. What motivated you to put together such a definitive reference? What tenets can be applied to one&#x2019;s everyday life?</p> <p><b>Gavin de Becker:</b> Most of all, we wrote the book we needed. My co-authors and I had long looked for an extensive collection of attack summaries from which important new insights could be harvested. Unable to find it, we committed to do the work ourselves, eventually collecting more than 1400 cases to analyze. Many new insights and concepts emerged from the study, and the one most applicable to day to day life, even for people who are not living with unusual risks, is to be in the present; pre-sent, as it were. Now is the only time anything ever happens--now is where the action is. All focus on anything outside the Now (the past, memory, the future, fantasy) detracts focus from what&#x2019;s actually happening in your environment. Human being have the capacity to look right at something and not see it, and in studying such a crisp event--the few seconds during which assassinations have occurred--<i>Just 2 Seconds</i> aims to enhance the reader&#x2019;s ability to see the value of the present moment.</p> <p>(Photo � Avery Helm)</p>"A how-to book that reads like a thriller...provocative...empowering." <br><i>--The Boston Globe</i><p>"De Becker has a lot to say about crime and the fear of crime, and he says it persuasively...his blend of empathy, reassurance and common sense wows readers."<br><i>--Newsweek</i></p><p>"Important and provocative." <br>--Linda A.

Included is his only novel, "Little" (1970), which John Leonard in the "New York Times" called "an odd, playful, thoroughly charming novel about a child prodigy." (The novel is very autobiographical and Zukofsky's son, violin virtuoso, Paul Zukofsky, has written an afterword for this edition.) Also included are the four stories comprising "It Was," published in 1961 in a limited edition and virtually unobtainable for years. The stories range from the brief title story in which a writer struggles with the composition of the perfect sentence to the novella length "Ferdinand," which Guy Davenport praised in the "New York Times Book Review" as "a finely tuned story from a sensibility of extraordinary range and skill."</p></p><p>Louis Zukofsky spent forty-sixyears writing his masterwork &#34;A,&#34; and died beforehe could see the completed versionpublished. Poet, translator, fictionwriter, essayist, anthologist, critic, teacher, WPA worker, and bindingforce of the Objectivist poets, Zukofsky was born in New York Cityand lived in or near the city hiswhole life.Born in New York of Russian immigrant parents, Zukofsky (1904-78) gained renown as a poet dedicated to verbal play, the poetic process and the link between language and music. These pursuits are evident in his fiction--four stories and a short novel--gathered for the first time in this volume that will appeal most to those interested in experimental fiction. Little is a humorous autobiographical novel on the early career of a violin prodigy, Baron Snorck, for which the author's son (virtuoso violinist Paul Zukofsky) provides notes and afterword. Zany and serious, the novel features Snorckie's friends, e.g., Ezra Pound, Arthur Rubenstein, their names disguised or spelled backwards (Caasi Nrets=Isaac Stern). "Ferdinand," the most ambitious story, connects the hero's life, dreams and fears to his automobile driving; the experimental "Thanks to the Dictionary" recalls Zukofsky's major poem "A." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Does The Queen Wear Her Crown in Bed?</h2><p>In this book a footman and two children explore Buckingham Palace to find the answers to many questions such as do you think The Queen wears her crown to bed?

Original.</p><p>Real-life soap actress Eileen Davidson brings a bland realism to her simplistic mystery series debut. When soap star Alexis Peterson discovers the body of a hated head writer, all suspicion is focused on her. Knowing her own innocence, she sets about trying to discover whodunit while avoiding harassment by the police, until the killer decides to come after her. Davidson throws in enough red herrings to keep readers guessing, but Peterson is a dry, self-centered protagonist with unclear motives and relationships. Her ostensible love triangle suggests uncertainty more on the author's part than the heroine's. The police are too nice to Peterson and she has no real conflict, especially with the mandatory gay best friend to give her perfect advice. Davidson's familiar name on the cover is the only thing that makes this mystery anything other than run-of-the-mill. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I am reprinting this book because I learned more useful information from this book than and other chess book I ever read. I memorized the entire book, every move in it, when I was 14. The way I was able to remember the entire book was that, for every move in the book, a reason for the move was given. So, if I was trying to remember what the next move was, I would remember the reason for the move. Once I remembered the reason for the move, then I could figure out what the move was. All of the lines in this book are still played at the top levels. None are obsolete. In addition, while some might consider them to be out of date, I think they are OK because the average chess book buyer is a 1300-1500 player, and they do not need to know the latest theoretical variations. The old lines will do just as well if not better.

Caesar the victor became Caesar the dictator, who was assassinated by Brutus on the Ides of March, 44 BC. From the ruin of the Republic arose Caesar&#x2019;s adopted son, Octavian, later Augustus, the first Roman Emperor. The crossing of the Rubicon by Caesar, in January 49 BC, is, quite simply, one of the most symbolic moments in world history. In three short books, Caesar describes how, in order to defend his <i>dignitas</i> (&#x2018;honour&#x2019;), and the <i>libertas</i> (&#x2018;freedom&#x2019;) of both himself and the Roman people, he marched on Rome, and defeated the forces of Pompey and the Senate in Italy, Spain, and Greece. Caesar&#x2019;s &#x2018;commentaries&#x2019;, written in famously simple prose, with the distinctive use of the third person, offer a unique opportunity to read the victor&#x2019;s version of events, written by one of the greatest figures in world history, the first &#x2018;Caesar&#x2019;.</p><p>Caius Julius Caesar was born on 13 July 100 BC. His family, the Julii, claimed descent from the ancient kings of Rome, and from the goddess Venus (through her son Aeneas). Caesar was the nephew of the general Caius Marius, and in his youth he witnessed the rise of the military warlords of the last years of the Roman Republic, Marius, Sulla, Crassus, and Pompey. He rapidly carved out an impressive political career of his own, forging an alliance with Pompey and Crassus in 60 BC. This won for him a military command in Gaul (southern France), and in ten years of spectacular campaigns he extended Roman rule to the Rhine and the Atlantic&#x2014;and mounted the first Roman invasion of Britain. But competition for honours with his contemporary Pompey the Great, and the political manoeuvres of other fellow senators, placed Caesar in what he saw as an untenable position. At the start of 49 BC, faced with the choice between political extinction and civil war, Caesar gambled on war and led a single legion of his Gallic veterans across the River Rubicon (which marked the northern boundary of &#x2018;Italy&#x2019;). The die was cast.&nbsp; The tradition that has built up around Caesar is immense and ambiguous. The reader will not find Caesar&#x2019;s famous quote in his writings&#x2014;&#x201d;I came, I saw, I conquered,&#x201d; after Zela, in Cilicia, in 47 BC. Although seemingly unfinished and unpublished at his death, the <i>Civil War</i> is instead his own attempt at an explanation of the war that changed the Roman world, a version summed up by the words placed in his mouth by one ancient biographer, Suetonius,: <i>hoc voluerunt</i>, &#x2018;they asked for it!&#x2019;</p><p>For all its apparent simplicity, the <i>Civil War</i> is not an easy work to understand, nor is Caesar an easy man to assess. The death of the regent of Egypt in late 48 BC, and not the death of Pompey (28 September 48 BC), marks the end of book three, and this is not an obvious point of closure. The Civil Wars, for Caesar, dragged on until the Battle of Munda in Spain in 45 BC. The account, as we have it, seems to have been published after Caesar&#x2019;s death, in 44 BC, by one of his officers, Aulus Hirtius, or so Hirtius himself tells us in the eighth and final book of Caesar&#x2019;s earlier commentaries on his Gallic Wars (covering 58-50 BC). Hirtius completed Caesar's <i>Gallic Wars</i> by writing book eight (52-50 BC), published Caesar&#x2019;s three books on the Civil War (49-48 BC), and then either he or another wrote the surviving commentaries on the Egyptian, African, and Spanish phases of the Civil Wars (48-45 BC). It is commonly accepted today that Caesar therefore wrote what we have as the <i>Civil War</i> no later than the winter of 48-47 BC, when he was held up in Alexandria (with Cleopatra); but that the events which followed, both in Egypt and Rome, culminating in his adoption of the position of Dictator for Life, rendered publication pointless in his eyes. In other words, his claims (especially at I.7 and 22) to be defending both his <i>dignitas</i> and the freedom of himself and others from the oppression of a <i>factio paucorum</i> (&#x2018;the faction of a few&#x2019;) rang increasingly hollow in his own ears as much as those of others, the more distant became the likelihood of a return to Republican normality.</p><p>Such a view requires brief consideration of the genre in which Caesar was writing and his reasons for writing. But to consider these things in turn demands that we examine the context for the Civil War itself. Throughout, the opinions of both contemporaries and later writers overshadow what can be said. When studying the ancient world, the evidence is always less than we would wish; it is particularly rich, comparatively speaking, for this moment in time, but nonetheless, it is highly partial. We have letters to and from the contemporary orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero, who struggled in vain to compose the strife; we have the writings of, and attributed to, the contemporary historian Sallust; we have the anti-Caesarian verse account of the Civil War by the Neronian poet Lucan (also known as the <i>Pharsalia</i>); we have the biographies of Caesar written by Plutarch and Suetonius, c.150 years after his death; and we have the historical accounts of Appian&#x2019;s <i>Civil Wars</i> and Cassius Dio&#x2019;s <i>Roman History</i>, written in the second and third centuries AD respectively. On the other hand, we do not have the contemporary history of Asinius Pollio, though it clearly underlies much of what does survive in other writers.</p><p>The writing of commentaries on campaigns was by no means a novel practice. It belonged to an age in which the writing of history, understood as the history of men, politics, and action, was commonplace, and had been ever since Thucydides had set forth his version of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, in which he had fought. However, commentaries in general were intended as notes for a proper literary history, not as a finished product by themselves. Caesar had already broken the mould with his <i>Gallic Wars</i>, of which Cicero wrote, in 46 BC:</p><p>They are like nude figures, straight and beautiful; stripped of all ornament of style as if they had laid aside a garment. His aim was to furnish others with material for writing history, and perhaps he has succeeded in gratifying the inept, who may wish to apply their curling irons to his material; but men of sound judgement he has deterred from writing, since in history there is nothing more pleasing than brevity, clear and correct.</p><p>We know that Caesar sent back reports to the Senate and People of Rome on a regular basis. The <i>Gallic War</i> is however something grander, even if still written up a year at a time, in the leisure of the winters between campaigns. These books belong in a culture in which the <i>gloria</i> won through military achievements was all-important, and its emphasis all the more necessary during a prolonged absence from Rome. We must assume the same thing for the <i>Civil War</i>. A shift in style has been suggested between the first two books, covering the year 49 BC, and the third, covering 48 BC. This would fit with annual composition.</p><p>Cicero&#x2019;s praise was written under Caesar the dictator. By contrast, Asinius Pollio, writing shortly after Caesar&#x2019;s death, thought the commentaries to have been written rather carelessly and with too little regard for the whole truth. The speed of composition and the probable lack of revision by Caesar himself might partly defend Caesar from such an accusation. Scholars have often sought to control Caesar&#x2019;s account, and although it is true that there are omissions (e.g., a mutiny by his legions, which belongs at II.22.6, but is reported only in later accounts such as Suetonius, <i>Divus Iulius</i> 69), disparities (compare Caesar&#x2019;s report of the negotiations attempted through N. Magius at Brindisium in I.24.4 and 26.2, with the letter of Caesar preserved among Cicero&#x2019;s <i>Letters to Atticus</i>, IX.13.a), and distortions (the chronological sequence of events in the opening phase of the war is not that implied by Caesar&#x2019;s account), it would be hard to accuse Caesar of gross falsehood. J. P. V. D. Balsdon concluded that &#x201c;Caesar could not claim to have written &#x2018;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&#x2019;.&#x201d; But the value of this lies, as Leo Raditsa observed, precisely in the fact that &#x201c;As often in first-rate ancient historians, Caesar desires his reader to think what he does not state outright.&#x201d; And to glimpse the mind of Caesar is a precious thing. The real problem, as so often, is that we lack sufficient contemporary evidence always to control Caesar&#x2019;s account.</p><p>However, the Gallic commentaries were written to bring home Caesar&#x2019;s achievements on behalf of the Roman state to the Roman people (or at least the upper echelons of the Roman people). As a motive&#x2014;and genre&#x2014;this sits very uncomfortably with a civil war fought against other members of the Roman senate. The exact reasons why Caesar should both have begun, and then abandoned, the attempt to write an account of his actions in a civil war will always remain obscure, but we can speculate. However, to do so we must consider the context and nature of the civil war.</p><p>&#x201c;Caesar would tolerate no superior, Pompey no equal.&#x201d; Such was the judgement of antiquity, and it deserves our notice. The Roman Republic was not a democracy (whatever the views expressed in the Translator&#x2019;s Introduction, on which see below). At its heart was a largely closed ruling elite. Members of this elite competed for office, and in particular the highest office, the consulate, to which two men were elected annually. Election was by the people, but the people were constituted in a fashion which favoured the wealthy, and voting was heavily influenced by political loyalties and alliances, by social bonds such as clientship, and by the use of wealth (which might be crudely, if not entirely accurately, classified as bribery). It is an unavoidable fact that the majority of those elected to the consulate came from families that had already achieved the consulate in the past. For this elite, one&#x2019;s <i>dignitas</i> (&#x2018;honour&#x2019;) and <i>auctoritas</i> (non-executive &#x2018;power&#x2019;, or &#x2018;influence&#x2019;) derived from the winning of honours such as the consulate, which lay in the gift of the Roman people and conferred <i>gloria</i>. Success in war had long been the most traditional means to the winning of such honours, and from this derived much of the Roman Republic&#x2019;s imperial success.</p><p>The success of the Republic in turn depended on the self-regulation by this elite of its internal competition. No one member could dominate&#x2014;he could do so only at the expense of his fellows, who could be expected to restrain him. The system, in principle, had enough honours to go round. In the later part of the Roman Republic, and especially in the period of Caesar&#x2019;s lifetime, this structure began to break down. The political machinery was that of a city-state, not a Mediterranean empire, and the expansion of empire led to an increase in the number of lesser magistracies, but not to a systematic revision of the constitution. Consequently, a growing number of men came to compete for the consulship, of which there were still only ever two per year. The growth of empire likewise meant that the rewards to be had from the consulship became ever greater. The system became further imbalanced with the increase in special, one-off commands to deal with specific problems, such as piracy, the corn-supply of Rome, or particular wars. Added to this, the Republic never developed a state-run, professional army, but rather, troops, employed on increasingly distant, long-term campaigns, became dependent upon the beneficence of their commanding officer, or some other politician, to finance their demobilization. In combination, this situation encouraged the rise of highly ambitious individuals, supported by veteran armies of soldiers trained on extended campaigns and who looked to their commander to provide for their futures. Such individuals, born to compete with their peers for honours, found themselves in situations where the normal restraints suddenly lacked any relevance. As Lucius Cornelius Sulla had starkly demonstrated, first in 87 BC and then again in 82 BC, all one had to do was march at the head of one&#x2019;s army to Rome and demand one&#x2019;s due. Those who resisted could be swept aside. But as R. Syme observed, &#x201c;the true glory of a Roman aristocrat [was] to contend with his peers for primacy, not to destroy them,&#x201d; and Caesar&#x2019;s defence of his <i>dignitas</i> was ultimately his undoing.</p><p>This is of course a gross simplification, but it will aid analysis. By the end of the 50s BC Caesar, and especially Pompey, had both held several extended commands, far beyond anything their predecessors or contemporaries could expect, or even match. Caesar had been consul in 59 BC, and proceeded from that to a hugely successful campaign of conquest in France, Belgium, and Germany, which by any normal expectation would have earned him quite spectacular honours and recognition on his return to Rome. Pompey, on the other hand, had achieved similar successes in the eastern Mediterranean in the 60s BC, and now held special commands for the control of Spain and the maintenance of the corn supply. He had won the consulship very early, back in 70 BC, and twice more in 55 and 52 BC. Caesar now aimed for the consulship again, an honour which he felt his due, but also one which he perhaps saw as necessary in order to maintain the position he had reached. Without it, further great commands would be difficult, but he would also find it hard to resist the attacks that were likely to come from other senators for his actions, not all of them entirely legal, over the preceding fifteen years.</p><p>Since 60 BC Caesar and Pompey had been in uneasy alliance, for their mutual advancement (together with Marcus Crassus, who died in 53 BC). Since antiquity, this unofficial triumvirate has often been seen (by Pollio, Horace, Lucan, and others) as the real start of the Civil War. The remainder of the Senate was still sufficiently powerful to resist the demands of figures such as Pompey and Caesar, and a small group of conservatives, under the leadership of a senator called Marcus Porcius Cato, had in general sought to resist such abnormal grants of honours. It was their opposition which had inspired the triumvirate in the first place. Conservative (<i>optimates</i> in Latin) is something of a misnomer, since the senatorial oligarchy, by its very nature, was conservative; the difference lay rather in the methods used to win <i>dignitas</i>, <i>gloria</i>, and <i>auctoritas</i>, either traditional or more popular (the <i>populares</i>); there was essentially no difference of opinion about the overall system. This group now sought to split apart the coalition of Pompey and Caesar, to bring Pompey within its number, and thereby to resist Caesar&#x2019;s claims all the more successfully. It was the resistance of this group to the idea that Caesar should receive preferential treatment in his pursuit of a second consulship (in particular the right to stand <i>in absentia</i>, while still holding his Gallic command) which directly caused the Civil War. That is, of course, not the same thing as to say that it was their fault (although some, both in antiquity and today, would lay the blame at Cato&#x2019;s door&#x2014;including Caesar, who claimed to resist the unjust &#x2018;faction of a few&#x2019; of Cato and his allies).</p></p><h2>Beowulf: The Donaldson translation, backgrounds and sources, criticism (A Norton critical edition)</h2><p>Translated into alliterative verse with a critical introduction.</p><p>This unique poetic rendering, available for the first time in a paperback edition, brings the experience of this earliest extant English poem closer to the modern reader.

She has been named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by <i>Time</i>, featured on more than thirty major Japanese television and radio programs, and profiled in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, <i>Red</i> magazine, <i>You</i> magazine, the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, NPR's <i>Here &amp; Now</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Family Circle</i>, and the <i>London&nbsp;Times, </i>who has deemed her &#x201c;Japan&#x2019;s preeminent guru of tidiness, a warrior princess in the war on clutter.&#x201d;Introduction<br><br>In this book, I have summed up how to put your space in order in a way that will change your life forever.<br><br> Impossible? A common response and not surprising, considering that almost everyone has experienced a rebound effect at least once, if not multiple times, after tidying.&nbsp;<br><br> Have <i>you</i> ever tidied madly, only to find that all too soon your home or workspace is cluttered again? If so, let me share with you the secret of success. <b>Start by discarding. Then organize your space, thoroughly, completely, in one go. </b>If you adopt this approach&#x2014;the KonMari Method&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll never revert to clutter again.<br><br> Although this approach contradicts conventional wisdom, everyone who completes my private course has successfully kept their house in order&#x2014;with unexpected results. Putting their house in order positively affects all other aspects of their lives, including work and family. Having devoted more than 80 percent of my life to this subject, I <i>know</i> that tidying can transform your life.<br><br> Does it still sound too good to be true? If your idea of tidying is getting rid of one unnecessary item a day or cleaning up your room a little at a time, then you are right. It won&#x2019;t have much effect on your life. If you change your approach, however, tidying can have an immeasurable impact. In fact, that is what it means to put your house in order.&nbsp;<br><br> I started reading home and lifestyle magazines when I was five, and it was this that inspired me, from the age of fifteen, to undertake a serious study of tidying that led to my development of the KonMari Method (based on a combination of my first and last names). I am now a consultant and spend most of my days visiting homes and offices, giving hands-on advice to people who find it difficult to tidy, who tidy but suffer rebounds, or who want to tidy but don&#x2019;t know where to start.<br><br> The number of things my clients have discarded, from clothes and undergarments to photos, pens, magazine clippings, and makeup samples, easily exceeds a million items. This is no exaggeration. I have assisted individual clients who have thrown out two hundred 45-liter <br> garbage bags in one go.<br><br> From my exploration of the art of organizing and my experience helping messy people become tidy, there is one thing I can say with confidence: <b>A dramatic reorganization of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective. It is life transforming. </b>I mean it. Here are just a few of the testimonies I receive on a daily basis from former clients.<br> <i>After your course, I quit my job and launched my own business doing something I had dreamed of doing ever since I was a child.Your course taught me to see what I really need and what I don&#x2019;t. So I got a divorce. Now I feel much happier.Someone I have been wanting to get in touch with recently contacted me.I&#x2019;m delighted to report that since cleaning up my&nbsp;apartment, I&#x2019;ve been able to really increase my sales.My husband and I are getting along much better.&nbsp;I&#x2019;m amazed to find that just throwing things away has changed me so much.&nbsp;I finally succeeded in losing ten pounds.<br></i><br> My clients always sound so happy, and the results show that tidying has changed their way of thinking and their approach to life. In fact, it has changed their future. Why? This question is addressed in more detail throughout the book, but basically, <b>when you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order, too. </b>As a result, you can see quite clearly what you need in life and what you don&#x2019;t, and what you should and shouldn&#x2019;t do.&nbsp;<br><br> I currently offer a course for clients in their homes and for company owners in their offices. These are all private, one-on-one consultations, but I have yet to run out of clients. There is currently a three-month waiting list, and I receive inquiries daily from people who have been introduced by a former client or who have heard about the course from someone else. I travel from one end of Japan to the other and sometimes even overseas. Tickets for one of my public talks for stay-at-home parents sold out overnight. There was a waiting list not only for cancellations but also for the waiting list. Yet my repeater rate is zero. From a business perspective, this would appear to be a fatal flaw. But what if my lack of repeaters was actually the secret to the popularity of my approach?&nbsp;<br><br> As I said at the beginning, people who use the KonMari Method never revert to clutter again. Because they can keep their space in order, they don&#x2019;t need to come back for more lessons. I occasionally check in with graduates of my courses to see how they are doing. In almost every case, not only is their home or office still in order but they are continuing to improve their space. It is evident from the photographs they send that they have even fewer belongings than when they finished the course, and have acquired new curtains and furnishings. <b>They are surrounded only by the things they love.&nbsp;<br></b><br> Why does my course transform people? Because my approach is not simply a technique. The act of tidying is a series of simple actions in which objects are moved from one place to another. It involves putting things away where they belong. This seems so simple that even a six-year-old should be able to do it. Yet most people can&#x2019;t. A short time after tidying, their space is a disorganized mess. The cause is not lack of skills but rather lack of awareness and the inability to make tidying a regular habit. In other words, the root of the problem lies in the mind. Success is 90 percent dependent on our mind-set. Excluding the fortunate few to whom organizing comes naturally, if we do not address this aspect, rebound is inevitable no matter how much is discarded or how cleverly things are organized.<br><br> So how can you acquire the right kind of mind-set? There is just one way, and, paradoxically, it is by acquiring the right technique. Remember: the KonMari Method I describe in this book is not a mere set of rules on how to sort, organize, and put things away. It is a guide to acquiring the right mind-set for creating order and becoming a tidy person.&nbsp;<br><br> Of course, I can&#x2019;t claim that all my students have perfected the art of tidying. Unfortunately, some had to stop for one reason or another before completing the course. And some quit because they expected me to do the work for them. As an organizing fanatic and professional, I can tell you right now that no matter how hard I try to organize another&#x2019;s space, no matter how perfect a storage system I devise, I can never put someone else&#x2019;s house in order in the true sense of the term. Why? Because a person&#x2019;s awareness and perspective on his or her own lifestyle are far more important than any skill at sorting, storing, or whatever. Order is dependent on the extremely personal values of what a person wants to live with.&nbsp;<br><br> Most people would prefer to live in a clean and tidy space. Anyone who has managed to tidy even once will have wished to keep it that way. But many don&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s possible. They try out various approaches to tidying only to find that things soon return to &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; I am absolutely convinced, however, that everyone can keep his or her space in order.&nbsp;<br><br> To do that, it is essential to thoroughly reassess your habits and assumptions about tidying. That may sound like far too much work, but don&#x2019;t worry. By the time you finish reading this book, you will be ready and willing. People often tell me, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m disorganized by nature,&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time&#x201d;; but being messy is not hereditary nor is it related to lack of time. It has far more to do with the accumulation of mistaken notions about tidying, such as &#x201c;it&#x2019;s best to tackle one room at a time&#x201d; or &#x201c;it&#x2019;s better to do a little each day&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage should follow the flow plan of the house.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In Japan, people believe that things like cleaning your room and keeping your bathroom spick-and-span bring good luck, but if your house is cluttered, the effect of polishing the toilet bowl is going to be limited. The same is true for the practice of feng shui. It is only when you put your house in order that your furniture and decorations come to life.<br><br> When you&#x2019;ve finished putting your house in order, your life will change dramatically. Once you have experienced what it&#x2019;s like to have a truly ordered house, you&#x2019;ll feel your whole world brighten. Never again will you revert to clutter. This is what I call <b>the magic of tidying. </b>And the effects are stupendous. Not only will you never be messy again, but you&#x2019;ll also get a new start on life. This is the magic I want to share with as many people as possible.</p><h2>Image on the Edge: The Margins of Medieval Art (Essays in Art and Culture)</h2><p>A gargoyle lurks at the corner of a Gothic cathedral. A monstrous face peers from the margin of a medieval text. At the far reaches of cultural spaces a chorus of odd and arresting figures assembles, commenting endlessly on the world it surveys. What these characters are doing at the margins is the subject of Michael Camille's new book, an exhilarating account of the medieval imagination testing--and defining--its boundaries.<br>Where others have isolated the marginal image as a detail, Camille considers such marginalia in direct and complex relation to the whole work. Ranging with graceful authority through the culture of the Middle Ages, from art to architecture, music to illustrated manuscripts, courtly romances to social rituals, he finds in the margins a distorted yet apt reflection of medieval conventions. It is here at the edge--of the monastery, the cathedral, the court, the city--that medieval artists found room for experimentation, for glossing, parodying, modernizing, and questioning cultural authority without ever undermining it. Viewing marginalia in their proper social and cultural context, Camille reveals scandalous and subversive aspects, as well as apparently paradoxical stabilizing functions. He rejects oppositions such as high and low, profane and sacred, and instead projects a vision of medieval culture in which marginal resistance, inversion, and transgression play an integral, even necessary, role.<br>Chimeras as disruptions of religious order; gargoyles as embodiments of fears and temptations; scatological drawings as manifestations of crisis in the chivalric class; charivari as ritual reinscriptions of social norms: Image on the Edge presents a vivid picture of a medieval world in which contradictions were not only tolerated, but worked with exquisite detail into the very fabric of society. With a richness of expression in keeping with his subject--and with a wealth of sumptuous illustrations--Camille illuminates these details; in doing so, he revises and enhances our understanding of medieval culture's self-representation.</p><p>In vigorous prose and 86 astonishing illustrations, Camille demonstrates how 'Gothic marginal art flourished from the late twelfth to the late fourteenth century by virtue of the absolute hegemony of the system it sought to subvert'--for 'premodern societies used ritualized disruption to reinstate social norms rather than resist them'...In this fine book how exhilarating it is to see our ancestors giggling and roaring in vulgar delight in the comforting shadows of their sacred texts and sanctuaries. (Richard Locke <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>A witty and original account of a fascinating subject. Medieval manuscripts, buildings and sculpture abound with subversive, erotic or scatological marginalia. Why are they there? Do they undermine dogma or just provide light relief? Camille gives some closely-observed and convincing answers. (Chris Savage King <i>New Statesman and Society</i>)<br><br>[A] sprightly and suggestive study. (Richard Eder <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Michael Camille offers us a book that distracts and instructs us simultaneously, in part because images are given as much play as texts. Camille's pages teem with ideas that, like medieval hybrids, are protean in their inventiveness. Rather than condemning the margins of medieval art, Camille celebrates them in animated, even exuberant prose, arguing in the process that their often overlooked representations pose as many problems as the center that more often has riveted our attention.

Written by one of the world&#39;s leading experts, it chronicles the history of the pewter industry in Europe, Britain and America from 1600 to 1850. The wide variety of marks found on pewter are fully discussed including makers marks, marks of quality, town and guild marks and capacity and ownership marks. The care and dating of pewter and the nature of fakes and reproductions are all examined. This comprehensive study with more than 1300 illustrations should prove to be the standard reference work that has been needed for many years.</p><p></p><h2>Toby&#39;s Room</h2><p>Toby's Room is the second novel in Pat Barker's Life Class Trilogy, returning to the First World War in a dark, compelling examination of human desire, wartime horror and the power of friendship When Toby is reported 'Missing, Believed Killed', another secret casts a lengthening shadow over Elinor's world: how exactly did Toby die - and why? Elinor determines to uncover the truth. Only then can she finally close the door to Toby's room. Moving from the Slade School of Art to Queen Mary's Hospital, where surgery and art intersect in the rebuilding of the shattered faces of the wounded, Toby's Room is a riveting drama of identity, damage, intimacy and loss - this is Pat Barker's most powerful novel yet.

Encouraged by Carter to continue writing and exploring the lives of working class women, she sent her fiction out to publishers. Thirty-five years later, she has published fifteen novels, including her masterful Regeneration Trilogy, been made a CBE for services to literature, and won awards including the Guardian Fiction Prize and the UK&#39;s highest literary honour, the Booker Prize. She lives in Durham and her new novel, The Silence of the Girls, will be published by Hamish Hamilton in August 2018.1<br><br>Elinor arrived home at four o&#x2019;clock on Friday and went straight to her room. She hung the red dress on the wardrobe door, glancing at it from time to time as she brushed her hair. That neckline seemed to be getting lower by the minute. In the end her nerve failed her. She hunted out her pink dress, the one she used to wear for dancing classes at school, put it on, and stood in front of the cheval mirror. She turned her head from side to side, her hands smoothing down the creases that had gathered round the waist. Oh dear. No, no, she couldn&#x2019;t do it, not this time, not ever again. She wriggled out of it and threw it to the back of the wardrobe. Out of the window would have been more satisfying, but her father and brother-in-law were sitting on the terrace. She pulled the red dress over her head, tugged the neckline up as far as it would go, and went reluctantly downstairs.<br><br>Father met her in the hall and hugged her as if he hadn&#x2019;t seen her for a year. Outside the living room, she hesitated, but there was no point wearing a red dress and then creeping along the skirting boards like a mouse, so she flung the door open and swept in. She kissed Rachel, waved at Rachel&#x2019;s husband, Tim, who was at the far side of the room talking to her mother, and then looked around for Toby, but he wasn&#x2019;t there. Perhaps he wasn&#x2019;t coming after all, though he&#x2019;d said he would. The prospect of his absence darkened the whole evening; she wasn&#x2019;t sure she could face it on her own. But then, a few minutes later, he came in, apologizing profusely, damp hair sticking to his forehead. He must&#x2019;ve been for a swim. She wished she&#x2019;d known; she&#x2019;d have gone with him. Not much hope of talking to him now; Mother had already beckoned him to her side.<br><br>Rachel was asking Elinor question after question about her life in London, who she met, who she went out with, did she have any particular friends? Elinor said as little as possible, looking for an excuse to get away. It was supplied by her mother, who appeared at her side and hissed, &#x201c;Elinor, go upstairs at once and take that ridiculous dress off.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment the gong sounded. Elinor spread her hands, all injured innocence, though underneath she felt hurt and humiliated. Yet again, she was being treated like a child.<br><br>Father came in at the last minute just as they were sitting down. She wondered at the curious mixture of poking and prying and secrecy that ruled their lives. Mother and Father saw very little of each other. She needed country air for the sake of her health; he lived at his club because it was such a convenient walking distance from the hospital, where he often had to be available late at night. Was that the reason for their weeklong separation? She doubted it. Once, crossing Tottenham Court Road, she&#x2019;d seen her father with a young woman, younger even than Rachel. They&#x2019;d just come out of a restaurant. The girl had stood, holding her wrap tightly round her thin shoulders, while Father flagged down a cab and helped her into it, and then they were whirled away into the stream of traffic. Elinor had stood and watched, open-mouthed. Father hadn&#x2019;t seen her; she was sure of that. She&#x2019;d never mentioned that incident to anyone, not even to Toby, though she and Toby were the only members of the family who kept no secrets from each other.<br><br>She sat in virtual silence for the first half of the meal&#x2014;sulking, her mother would have said&#x2014;though Tim did his clumsy best to tease her out of it. Did she have a young man yet? Was all this moodiness because she was in love?<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time for anything like that,&#x201d; Elinor said, crisply. &#x201c;They work us too hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you know what they say, don&#x2019;t you? All work and no play . . . ?&#x201d; He turned to Toby. &#x201c;Have you seen her with anybody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet, but I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s only a matter of time.&#x201d;<br><br>Toby&#x2019;s joining in the teasing, however reluctantly, was all it took to chafe Elinor&#x2019;s irritation into fury.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you must know I have met somebody.&#x201d; She plucked a name from the air. &#x201c;Kit Neville.&#x201d;<br><br>This was not true: she&#x2019;d hardly spoken to Kit Neville. He was merely the loudest, the most self-confident, the most opinionated, and, in many ways, the most obnoxious male student in her year, and therefore the person she thought of first.<br><br>&#x201c;What does he do?&#x201d; Mother asked. Predictably.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a student.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of student?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Art. What else would he be doing at the Slade?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you met his family?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now why on earth would I want to do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s what people do when&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re about to get engaged? Well, I&#x2019;m not. We&#x2019;re just friends. Very good friends, but . . . friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need to be careful, Elinor,&#x201d; Rachel said. &#x201c;Living in London on your own. You don&#x2019;t want to get a reputation . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do want to get a reputation, as it happens. I want to get a reputation as a painter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, for heaven&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Elinor,&#x201d; her father said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;<br><br>So even Father was turning against her. The last mouthful of cheese and biscuit sticking in her dry throat, Elinor followed her mother and Rachel out of the dining room. They sat over a pot of coffee that nobody wanted, staring at their reflections in the black windows that overlooked the airless terrace. The windows couldn&#x2019;t be opened because of moths. Rachel had a horror of moths.<br><br>&#x201c;So who is this Mr. Neville?&#x201d; Mother asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody, he&#x2019;s in my year, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said classes weren&#x2019;t mixed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some are, some aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She could barely speak for exasperation; she&#x2019;d brought this on herself. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s not as if we&#x2019;re going out . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So why mention him?&#x201d; Rachel&#x2019;s voice was slurry with tiredness. Tendrils of damp hair stuck to her forehead; she&#x2019;d eaten scarcely anything. She yawned and stretched her ankles out in front of her. &#x201c;Look at them. Puddings.&#x201d; She dug her fingers into the swollen flesh as if she hated it.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be worn out in this heat,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you put your feet up?&#x201d;<br><br>Feet up in the drawing room? Unheard of. But then Elinor intercepted a glance between the two women, and understood. She wondered when she was going to be told. What a family they were for not speaking. She wanted to jump on the table and shout out every miserable little secret they possessed, though, apart from the breakdown of her parents&#x2019; marriage, she couldn&#x2019;t have said what the secrets were. But there was something: a shadow underneath the water. Swim too close and you&#x2019;d cut your feet. A childhood memory surfaced. On holiday somewhere, she&#x2019;d cut her foot on a submerged rock; she&#x2019;d felt no pain, only the shock of seeing her blood smoking into the water. Toby had taken off his shirt and wrapped it round her foot, then helped her back to the promenade. She remembered his pink fingers, wrinkled from the sea, the whorl of hair on the top of his head as he bent down to examine the cut.<br><br>Why couldn&#x2019;t they leave her alone? All this nonsense about young men . . . It was just another way of drilling it into you that the real business of a girl&#x2019;s life was to find a husband. Painting was, at best, an accomplishment; at worst, a waste of time. She was trying to hold on to her anger, but she&#x2019;d suppressed it so long it was threatening to dissipate into depression. As it so often did. Why hadn&#x2019;t Toby spoken up for her? Instead of just sitting there, fiddling with his knife and fork.<br><br>She was thoroughly fed up. As soon as possible after the men joined them, she excused herself, saying she needed an early night.<br><br>As she closed the door behind her, she heard Father ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you know,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;Girls.&#x201d;<br><br>Meaning? Nothing that made her feel better about herself, or them.<br>Next morning after breakfast Toby announced that he was going to walk to the old mill.<br><br>&#x201c;In this heat?&#x201d; Mother said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too bad. Anyway, it&#x2019;ll be cooler by the river.&#x201d;<br><br>Elinor followed him into the hall. &#x201c;Do you mind if I come?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Toby, I walk all over London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Rachel hear you say that. Rep-u-tation!&#x201d;<br><br>They arranged to meet on the terrace. Soon Elinor was following her brother across the meadow, feeling the silken caress of long grasses against her bare arms and the occasional cool shock of cuckoo spit.<br><br>&#x201c;You know this chap you were talking about last night . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t you start.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was only asking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I only mentioned him because I&#x2019;m sick of being teased. I just wanted to get Tim off my back. Instead of which, I got Mother onto it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Rachel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s worse than Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s jealous, that&#x2019;s all. She settled down a bit too early and . . . Well, she didn&#x2019;t exactly get a bargain, did she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like Tim, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s harmless. I just don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s very happy.&#x201d; He turned to face her. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t make that mistake, will you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marrying Tim? Shouldn&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No-o. Settling down too early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t intend to &#x2018;settle down&#x2019; at all.&#x201d;<br><br>She hoped that was the end of the subject, but a minute later Toby said, &#x201c;All the same, there has to be a reason you mentioned him&#x2014;I mean, him, rather than somebody else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfectly obnoxious, that&#x2019;s why. He was just the first person who came to mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Once they reached the river path, there was some shade at last, though the flashing of sunlight through the leaves and branches was oddly disorientating, and more than once she tripped over a root or jarred herself stepping on air.<br><br>&#x201c;Be easier coming back,&#x201d; Toby said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t have the sun in our eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t want to go on talking. She was content to let images rise and fall in her mind: her lodgings in London, the Antiques Room at the Slade, the friends she was starting to make, the first few spindly shoots of independence, though it all seemed a little unreal here, in this thick heat, with dusty leaves grazing the side of her face and swarms of insects making a constant humming in the green shade.<br><br>She was walking along, hardly aware of her surroundings, when a sudden fierce buzzing broke into her trance. Toby caught her arm. Bluebottles, gleaming sapphire and emerald, were glued to a heap of droppings in the center of the path. A few stragglers zoomed drunkenly towards her, fastening on her eyes and lips. She spat, batting them away.<br><br>&#x201c;Here, this way,&#x201d; Toby said. He was holding a branch for her so she could edge past the seething mass.<br><br>&#x201c;Fox?&#x201d; she asked, meaning the droppings.<br><br>&#x201c;Badger, I think. There&#x2019;s a sett up there.&#x201d;<br><br>She peered through the trees, but couldn&#x2019;t see it.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember we had a den here once?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>She remembered the den: a small, dark, smelly place under some rhododendron bushes. Tiny black insects crawled over your skin and fell into your hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it was here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was. You could just hear the weir.&#x201d;<br><br>She listened, and sure enough, between the trees, barely audible, came the sound of rushing water.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I remember now. I thought it was a bit farther on.&#x201d;<br><br>She thought he might want to go there, he lingered so long, but then he turned and walked on.<br><br>The river was flowing faster now, picking up leaves and twigs and tiny, struggling insects and whirling them away, and the trees were beginning to thin out. More and more light reached the path until, at last, they came out into an open field that sloped gently down towards the weir. A disused mill&#x2014;the target of their walk&#x2014;stood at the water&#x2019;s edge, though it was many years since its wheel had turned.<br><br>This had been the forbidden place of their childhood. They were not to go in there, Mother would say. The floorboards were rotten, the ceilings liable to collapse at any minute . . .<br><br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t go near the water,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d call after them, in a last desperate attempt to keep them safe, as they walked away from her down the drive. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d chorus. &#x201c;Promise,&#x201d; Toby would add, for good measure, and then they would glance sideways at each other, red-faced from trying not to giggle.<br><br>Now, Elinor thought, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t bother going in, but Toby went straight to the side window, prised the boards apart, and hoisted himself over the sill. After a second&#x2019;s hesitation Elinor followed.<br><br>Blindness, after the blaze of sunlight. Then, gradually, things became clear: old beams, cobwebs, tracks of children&#x2019;s footprints on the dusty floor. Their own footprints? No, of course not, couldn&#x2019;t be, not after all these years. Other children came here now. She put her foot next to one of the prints, marveling at the difference in size. Toby, meanwhile, was expressing amazement at having to duck to avoid the beams.<br><br>Because this place had been the scene of so many forbidden adventures, an air of excitement still clung to it, in spite of the dingy surroundings. She went across to the window and peered out through a hole in the wall. &#x201c;I wonder what it was like to work here.&#x201d;<br><br>Toby came across and stood beside her. &#x201c;Pretty good hell, I should think. Noise and dust.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right, of course; when the wheel turned the whole place must have shook. She turned to him. &#x201c;What do you think&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br><br>He grabbed her arms and pulled her towards him. Crushed against his chest, hardly able to breathe, she laughed and struggled, taking this for the start of some childish game, but then his lips fastened onto hers with a groping hunger that shocked her into stillness. His tongue thrust between her lips, a strong, muscular presence. She felt his chin rough against her cheek, the breadth of his chest and shoulders, not that round, androgynous, childish softness that had sometimes made them seem like two halves of a single person. She started to struggle again, really struggle, but his hand came up and cupped her breast and she felt herself softening, flowing towards him, as if something hard and impacted in the pit of her stomach had begun to melt.<br><br>And then, abruptly, he pushed her away.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m sorry. Sorry, sorry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t speak. How was it possible that anybody, in a single moment, could stumble into a chasm so deep there was no getting out of it?<br><br>&#x201c;Look, you go back,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come home later.&#x201d;<br><br>Automatically, she turned to go, but then remembered the river and turned back.<br><br>&#x201c;No, go on, I&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll wonder what&#x2019;s happened if I show up on my own.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Baha&#39;i Faith: An Introduction</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>The Children&#39;s Illustrated Bible</h2><p>Presents more than one hundred stories from the Old and New Testaments, accompanied by photographs, maps, and illustrations.</p><p>A smaller, fatter version of Selina Hastings's outstanding edition of <i>The Children's Illustrated Bible</i>, this child-size volume is just right for the beginning Bible student. Hastings retells the stories of the Old and New Testaments in a lucid, flowing style for children's enjoyment and edification. Hastings consulted with a cadre of educators, scholars, and religious advisors to retain the original feel and poetry of the Bible, while appealing to contemporary young readers with clear, lively language. The somewhat lackluster illustrations on every page are not nearly as compelling as the stories themselves, but the variety of other artwork, including maps and color photographs of artifacts, plants, biblical places, animals, people, and architecture, makes up for any deficit there. All the best-known parables and teachings are here, including "The Golden Calf," "Sodom and Gomorrah," "The Garden of Eden," "Jesus Walks on the Water," The Parable of the Talents," and "The Crucifixion," among many others. This volume also includes a "Who's Who in the Bible Stories" as well as quotations from the King James Bible, identified by chapter and verse. Hastings has written several other collections of Bible stories, including <i>The Birth of Jesus</i> and <i>The Miracles of Jesus</i>. (Ages 8 and older)Selina Hastings is the author of several children's books that reflect her interest in language and history including <i>Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady</i> and <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. <br><br> Eric Thomas, a teacher of graphics, print, and illustration, has worked as a freelance illustrator for the BBC, <i>The Times of London</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>.</p><h2>Goliath: Hero of the Great Baltimore Fire (True Stories)</h2><p>In 1904 the city of Baltimore was almost destroyed by fire. Hundreds of firemen, policemen, soldiers, and citizens battled the blaze for three days. The disaster brings out the best in man and the bravest of deeds, but one hero stands head and shoulders above all...literally. Goliath is a fire horse assigned to Engine Company 15. He is massive in size and mighty in heart and steadfastness. To the men of Engine Company 15, Goliath is the ultimate fire horse. He is the lead horse for the team assigned to pulling the mammoth Hale Water Tower No. 1. When the fire alarm sounds, calling them to action, Goliath leads his team into the blaze. Soon his lifesaving actions will lead him into the pages of history. Masterful artwork from acclaimed illustrator Troy Howell brings this true story to pulse-pounding life. Educator Claudia Friddell says of her work researching Goliath, &#34;It was a privilege to meet and interview firefighters and fire historians about the Baltimore Fire of 1904.&#34; Goliath is her first children&#39;s book. Claudia lives in Baltimore, Maryland. Artist Troy Howell has had a prolific career as a children&#39;s book illustrator with countless books to his credit, including The Secret Garden, The Ugly Duckling, and Favorite Greek Myths. He received his formal art education from the Art Center in Los Angeles and the Illustrators&#39; Workshops in New York.

Friddell brings the event to life through the true story of a huge horse from Engine Company 15. Goliath bore the full brunt of an explosion and then heroically pulled an entire fire rig to safety by himself. The text builds suspense as it traces the path of the fire, ending with Goliath's scarred but triumphant return to his post six months after the fire. Howell's expressive, sepia-toned illustrations interplay with the text to keep readers in the moment. Exciting, historically accurate, and visually appealing, this book is an excellent addition to the classroom or the pleasure-reading pile.<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, MD</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

His restless, inventive mind leads him to observe the life of the river frequently missed by occasional visitors. </p><p>He even develops a host of highly original fly patterns - like the Funneldun, the Caddox and the Deerstalker, now known internationally - and perfects fly-fishing techniques and theories of immense value to fishermen world wide. </p><p>No serious fly fisherman will want to miss this engaging, practical and penetrating memoir.</p></p><p>Twenty years ago Patterson left a London ad agency to live and fish along a small river. He has spent the time observing the behavior of flies, trout, water, and other fishers on his beat. As a result, he has developed unorthodox styles of tying?emphasizing behavior over appearance?that have became orthodox owing to their success. He has fished in Europe and the Americas and written for international fly-fishing journals. This engaging, thoughtful, gently humorous memoir, a composite of one year's seasons on the river, with Patterson's own delightful drawings, should bring him to a larger audience?indeed, to anyone interested in why people fish and why some are more successful at it than others. Appendixes provide charts to identify natural flies and give details of his artificial patterns. Recommended to those who fish for the "pure fun of it" and to public libraries everywhere.?Roland Person, Southern Illinois Univ.

The films of this era record how gender and sexuality did not easily come together in a normative manhood common to American men. Instead these films demonstrate the widely held perception of a crises of masculinity. Masked Men documents how movies of the fifties represented masculinity as a multiple masquerade. Hollywood&#x2019;s star system positioned the male actor as a professional performer and as a body intended to solicit the erotic interest of male and female viewers alike. Drawing on publicity, poster art, fan magazines, and the popular press as a means of following the links between fifties stars, their films, and the social tensions of the period, Cohan juxtaposes Hollywood&#x2019;s narratives of masculinity against the personae of leading men like Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, William Holden, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, and Rock Hudson. Masked Men focuses on the gender and sexual masquerades that organized their performances of masculinity on and off screen. </p></p><p><p>Steve Cohan, Professor of English at Syracuse University, is co-author of Telling Stories: A Theoretical Analysis of Narrative Fiction, co-editor of Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in Hollywood Cinema, and The Road Movie Book.

This hallowed tradition helped ancient Egyptians develop a close and enduring relationship with one of their most beloved goddesses: Isis. <br> <br>M. Isidora Forrest, an ordained priestess of the Fellowship of Isis, guides magical practitioners down a modern, devotional path to this popular Egyptian goddess. She discusses the theory and practice of ancient offering rites and shows how they can be applied today for spiritual growth and sacred magic. Readers can choose from over seventy scripted offerings to Isis-from "Acacia" to "Words of Power." Also included are the sacred hieroglyphs associated with Isis and how these powerful, magical &nbsp;symbols can aid in forging a strong connection with the goddess. <br></p><p><b>M. Isidora Forrest</b> has been a devotee of the Goddess Isis for more than fifteen years. She is an initiated Prophetess of the House of Isis, and in 1997 she was formally ordained by Arch-Hierophant Olivia Robertson as a Priestess of the international Fellowship of Isis. Forrest has also earned the title of Adept for her more than twenty years of study in a one-hundred-year-old Hermetic magical tradition. <br> <br>Ten years ago, Forrest and her husband founded the Hermetic Fellowship, a legally recognized, not-for-profit religious organization. Today, the Fellowship offers a mix of ritual for worship, celebration, and spiritual growth, as well as workshops and classes devoted to education in the Western esoteric tradition. <br> <br>Forrest is the author of "Divination in the Greco-Egyptian Magical Papyri," in The Golden Dawn Journal, Book I; "The Equilibration of Jehovah"in <i>The Golden Dawn Journal, Book II</i>; "The Hermetic Isis"in <i>The Golden Dawn Journal, Book III</i>; and "Pagans and Neo-Pagans"in <i>Magical Pantheons</i>, all of which were edited by Chic and Tabatha Cicero and published by Llewellyn. <br>Birth of Isis. Feast of "revealing the face" of this goddess with her ennead. Performing all the rites of the feast of robing . . . according to the ritual of the place of the First Feast. They make a great oblation of bread, beer, oxen, fowl, wine, milk, pomegranate-wine, [gazelles, oryx, ibex], cranes, pigeons, fattened ducks, with fresh vegetables and all fruit. It is sweet to serve the Beautiful One with right offerings! <br><b>-The Denderah Festival Calendar <br> <br></b>Each night while I sleep, the light is withdrawn, and a darkened world returns to primordial chaos. This disorder is Isfet, the opposite of Mayet-Rightness, Truth. Like dark water, Isfet is of infinite, even frightening possibility. Will it seep up moist like ground water, like dreams, to nourish growth and change? Or will it burst forth, unchecked, unsettling, and destructive? Anything might happen. Anything might exist out there in night's shadowed darkness. <br> <br>The formlessness of the unillumined world is why I welcome with full heart the awakening of the Golden One each morning. As She scatters Her gold dust across the world-bringing light, creating form-I release my breath to Her in relieved sighs. I am Her servant. I serve the Great Goddess Isis. "Ise" is how we whisper Her holy name. I am called The First of Those Who See Her, for it is my privilege and duty to open Her shrine, unveil Her face, and make offering to Her each morning. I know better than most how sweet it is to serve the Beautiful One with right offerings. <br> <br>While Isfet is still trembling at the edges of the world, I rise and make my purifications. My body, which will perform the ritual, is made pure with water. My mouth, which will speak the words of power, is made pure with natron. It is salty, and if I have much to purify, it sometimes makes me gag. When I am cleansed, I put on the white linen and white sandals and walk through the night-cooled corridors of the temple toward Her closed shrine. <br> <br>The cooks, the bakers, the butchers have already been at work. They have prepared Her morning feast. The Pure Ones, the Wab priests and priestesses, have placed it in the Hall of Offerings, and even now they chant for Her. The sistra of the priestesses rattle softly as I pass through the Hall of Offerings to finally stand before the closed doors of Her shrine. <br> <br>Into the darkness before that sacred place, I speak the words that avert evil so that I may approach, giving no offense and receiving no harm. I break the clay seal. I draw back the bolt, but I do not yet open the doors. First I must offer incense to Her Eye, the fierce and fiery Serpent Goddess Who guards the Great One-another of Isis' kheperu, Her forms. When that Fierce One has taken Her pleasure and been pacified by the incense and the words of my mouth, I open the doors. Heaven and Earth open before me! <br> <br>On my knees, I enter Her shrine, offering incense. The sweet smoke rises into the still air to encircle the Iset Weret, the Great Seat or Throne of the Goddess, Her innermost holy place. My heart remembers one of the Mysteries of my temple: Isis is both She Who is Upon Her Throne, and also the Throne itself, for that is the very meaning of Her name. Isis is All Things; it is a great secret that I know as I prostrate myself before the Goddess Throne. I kiss the ground. My belly touches the Earth before Her. I speak the Adoration of the Goddess with all my heart. As they do every morning that I wear the white sandals to serve my Goddess, tears blur the vision of my eyes when I lift the Goddess' veil to look upon Her beautiful face. <br> <br>Isis is alive in Her sacred image. The Goddess is at home in Her temple. I can feel Her magic vibrate within the shrine. Her ka speaks to mine. I bid Her peace in awakening. In Her presence, I purify the food offerings with water and with incense. I name what we have prepared for Her. She smiles at me with golden lips. <br> <br>I am now privileged to touch Her image. I take Her sacred body from the Great Throne into the shrine chamber. I wipe away yesterday's unguent, She having received its ka. With the little finger of my right hand, with my gentle finger, I anoint the uraeus upon Her brow anew with Eye of Horus Oil. It makes Her limbs whole. It destroys evil like the strong talons of Her falcon child. <br> <br>I remove the linen cloths placed upon Her image the day before. They will be taken away and washed. With Her unclothed image before me, I adore Her four times. I feel tender toward the Goddess Whose body I touch. I speak only truth before Her. My adorations are never rote. I speak heart-words to my Goddess. As I reclothe Her in fresh linens-the white, the green, and the red-I purify with natron between each dressing. I purify again with water and incense. I circle Her image four times before returning it to its seat. <br> <br>Once more upon Her Great Throne, Isis receives Her ornaments and implements of power. I place them upon Her body. I offer Her precious unguents, full of strength. I take up pure sand, and with ancient and holy words, I pour it out before Her. It grits beneath my white sandals as I enfold Her image, first in the white head cloth, then in the Great Cloth. Now She is veiled once more in the protection of the Weaving Goddesses, Who spin magic into linen. <br> <br>Again I offer incense and circle Her living image four times. I take up the bundle of heden plants. As I back out of the shrine, I use them to sweep the sand clean, obliterating my footprints and returning the holy place to its primordial perfection. I close the doors, bolt them. Outside, I offer incense upon the brazier and circle the room four times, speaking protections. <br> <br>By the time the rite is complete, the sun is high above the horizon. Day has come. Isfet is banished. The face of Isis shines like molten gold as She smiles upon Egypt. I am content. <br> <br>Offering and Relationship <br> <br>Human beings have always made offering to their Deities. Many have also honored their dead with offerings, as the ancient Egyptians did. <br> <br>Our ancestors offered the choicest cut of meat to the Great Hunter Who had helped them in their hunt. They gave the first handful of ripe berries to the Wild Mother Who had guided them to the mouth-watering cache. They shared their holy days and good fortune by offering feasts to their dead. They filled temples with sumptuous meals and beautiful scents for the Goddesses and Gods. They created art in enduring stone and precious metals and offered it to the Divine Houses. <br> <br>Many of us continue to make offering today. Some Christian church members tithe, giving offerings to support the work of their church. Hindu devotees offer daily puja to their Deities. Tibetan Buddhists make offering of fire and pure water. Neo-Pagans offer fresh flowers and incense on the altars of their Goddesses and Gods. Artists of all faiths still create in the name of the Divine and offer their creations back to their Divine inspirers. It seems that there is an inborn impulse in us to make offering. <br> <br>One modern example of that impulse concerns the Seattle Troll. Large enough to hold a VW Beetle in one hand, staring out of a single, glassy eye, the Seattle Troll lives beneath the Aurora Bridge in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. He was originally a work of art funded by the city, but he has become something more. He has become a "Work of Art" and now receives offerings from passersby and neighborhood residents. <br> <br>The day I visited-not a special day, just a weekday like any other-the Troll was supplied with an amazing array of offerings. There were fresh flowers, smoked almonds, jewelry, coins, jams, a bag of ripe cherries, a whole watermelon, a bright pink-orange slab of raw salmon, a whole Dungeness crab, a bar of soap, a pack of cigarettes, two coffee mugs, and two t-shirts. These offerings were fresh, too-the flowers and food as yet unwilted. At first, it looked like someone had temporarily left their picnic, but no. The votives were carefully arranged upon the enormous hands of the Troll. They were clearly presented, and no picnickers were to be found. The items were offerings, nothing less. <br> <br>The fact that people expend their energy, time, and money in making offering to the Troll is surely one of the things that has made him come alive. The vivified Troll now serves as a focus for the neighborhood, celebrating with residents during local festivals like "Trolloween," and lamenting with them in tragedy. After a particularly terrible bus accident in the area, a large tear appeared beneath the eye of the Troll. <br> <br>I doubt that any of those who offer to the Troll see him as a Deity-at most, he's a quirky neighborhood spirit. Yet, people leave offerings just the same. Perhaps it's because when we make offering, we are seeking relationship. In the case of the Troll, perhaps we seek connection with the progressive spirit of the neighborhood. Maybe the Troll's mere existence gives us a chuckle and we offer a gift of thanks, connecting with those who share our amusement, or with the Troll's artist-creators. If we participate in the Trolloween festival, we come into relationship with other revelers. <br> <br>In a spiritual context, making offering can be a joyful sharing of blessings with the Deity or spirits with whom we have or seek a relationship. As an act of gift-giving, offering is a universal way to create the sweet bonds of interconnection and ongoing reciprocity between giver and receiver. Offering encourages generosity in the giver. Some Tibetan Buddhists say that it is this growing generosity in ourselves that pleases the Deities, rather than the actual offerings. Offering can be a meditation, a prayer, a way to honor tradition, an act of devotion, a method of giving thanks, a path to greater openness of spirit. <br> <br>Of course, like most things, offering can also be abused. At its worst, it is a fruitless attempt at Divine bribery; but this is only true when the offering is given out of fear or out of a desire to manipulate, rather than being motivated by love or joy. In this book, we're concerned with the latter type of offering: offerings of love, appreciation, joy, growth, and connection. Specifically, we are concerned with the offering tradition of ancient Egypt-as well as its modern Neo-Egyptian inspiration and reinterpretation-as a way to develop and deepen a relationship with the Great Egyptian Goddess Isis. (For more on creating a relationship with Isis, please see my book Isis Magic, Llewellyn, 2001.) <br> <br><b>Weaving Connections <br> <br></b>The spread offered to the Troll pales in comparison with the offerings provided each day in the ancient temples of the Egyptian Deities. Making offering was essential to the Egyptian relationship with the Divine, while the relationship itself was essential to the proper functioning of the universe. The Egyptians knew that the universal order hinged upon the ongoing, interwoven relationship between Divine and human, natural and supernatural. If human beings failed to provide right worship to the Deities-a significant part of which was the act of making offering-the world would dissolve into chaos and the Goddesses and Gods would not have the energy required to maintain and renew the physical universe. Offering was considered such a key part of the functioning of the universe that there are numerous representations of Deities making offering to each other. At Isis' temple at Philae, the Goddess was known to make libation offerings to Her beloved Osiris every ten days. The temple calendar from Esna notes that She also made offering to Osiris (and to another Deity Whose name is lost) on the tenth day of the first month of the season of Inundation. <br> <br>The literal nourishment of the Deities was a main function of offering. For example, one of the inscriptions at Osiris' great temple complex at Abydos in northern Upper Egypt says that the king endows the offering tables of Osiris, fills His house with fresh greens, and pours Him libations from golden vessels so that the God "may live. <br> <br>Offerings were also given to thank the Goddesses and Gods for what They had provided to humankind. In one of the hymns to Hapi, the Nile God Whose flooding enriched Egyptian fields, the hymnist offers a feast to Hapi, stating, "your generosity is repaid to you." Harvest was always a time for such thank offerings. As the Goddesses and Gods gave the food of the harvest to human beings, so They were always given a share of the abundance in return. <br> <br>It was also important that the person making the offering be worthy-which explains why offering made by the Deities was particularly powerful. In a text known as the Instruction for Merikare, one of the Egyptian "wisdom texts," the king is advised to do monthly service as a temple priest. As a priest, one of his tasks is to increase the daily offerings because it is "good for the future." Later in the same text, the king is reminded that the character of the giver is more important than the offerings themselves, for the "good character of a righteous man" is more acceptable to the Divine than the "splendid ox" of a wrongdoer. <br> <br>At the same time, the offerent (the person making offering) expected to receive benefits from her or his generosity. In the same way that the Deity gave and received in return, so the giver gave, then received from the Deity. In the chapel of Sokar at Abydos, the king asks Sokar to accept a bread offering "that I may live, that I may be joyful, that I may unite with thee." By giving and receiving, receiving and giving, the connections between human and Divine, Divine and human, were eternally woven and rewoven. The interdependence between the worlds was continually strengthened and sweetened by the giving of gifts. <br> <br><b>The Place of Offering: Ancient Altars <br> <br></b>In prehistoric times, Egyptians placed their gifts on small woven-reed mats. The most characteristic offering was a cone-shaped loaf of bread or a small pile of grain or flour. The conical loaf or heaped grain on a mat was so typical that a stylized version of it became the hieroglyph hotep, which is used in words such as "offering" and "altar," and was the most common word for "offering." <br> <br>In Egyptian representations of offering scenes, the bottom of the hotep sign-the mat-always faces the Deity or spirit receiving the offering. Eventually, the hotep glyph became a symbol of plenty and generosity, and was sometimes shown carried by Deities associated with food and fertility. Hotep also signifies the concepts of rest, peace, happiness, and satisfaction. The idea behind this extension of hotep's meaning is that offerings are given in gratitude and received in grace, leading to satisfaction and peace for both giver and receiver. &nbsp;The Egyptians also used the word hotep as a salutation. People wished each other peace and satisfaction-and, by implication, many offerings-in their daily comings and goings. The word is still used as a greeting by some modern devotees of the Egyptian Deities. <br> <br>There is a common offering formula-that is, ritual words spoken when making an offering-known as the hotep di nisu. It translates as "an offering that the king gives." It was commonly used when the king was depicted making offering, since all the offerings given to the Deities symbolically came from the king.

Of these, Republic Pictures Corporation was the finest. Their quality B action pictures and serials influenced the industry and the moviegoing public, resulting in greater public acceptance. The Republic&#39;s roster of talent included John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and Gene Autry, and the serials it produced featured such iconic figures as Dick Tracy, Captain America, Zorro, and The Lone Ranger.In Republic Studios: Between Poverty Row and the Majors, author Richard Hurst documents the influence and significance of this major B studio. Originally published in 1979, this book provides a brief overview of the studio&#39;s economic structure and charts its output. Hurst examines the various genres represented by the studio, including the comedies of Judy Canova and westerns featuring Autry, Rogers, and The Three Mesquiteers. The book addresses the non-series B films Republic produced, as well as rare A films such as Wake of the Red Witch, Sands of Iwo Jima, and John Ford&#39;s The Quiet Man, all of which starred John Wayne. This new edition of Republic Studios, with two additional expanded chapters on serials, a new introduction, and an epilogue, brings the Republic story up to date. This fascinating look at Republic chronicles the impact the studio had on American cultural history from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s and examines the studio&#39;s role in Hollywood history and its demise in the late &#39;50s.</p><p><b>Richard M.

But in April of 1890, they turned lucky for her. On the first Friday of the month, a note arrived from an anonymous admirer, delicately sprinkled with rose-scented tears. On the second Friday, she supervised the placement of the final pagoda in the garden at Heaton Dale. And on the third Friday, beneath an unseasonably bright sun, three hundred of London&#x2019;s most fashionable citizens filed into church to witness her marriage to Viscount Pennington.<br> <br>Gwen waited on her feet, in a little antechamber off the nave, a wholly unnecessary fire crackling in the hearth. The ceremony should have started half an hour ago, but (so Belinda had told her, in a brief visit to ensure that her veil still sat straight) the guests were too busy consorting to be seated. The brightest lights of society were convening, some for the first time since last season; according to one of the social columns this morning, &#x201c;Only the angelic Miss Maudsley, whom everybody adores,&#x201d; could gather a crowd of such numbers before Whitsuntide.<br> <br>Gwen took a deep breath and cast her eyes to the window above her. It was not odd, really, that she wished she were in the pews, exchanging greetings. Or outside, even. In the park. The air in here felt stifling, far too warm.<br> <br>The walls seemed to be closing in.<br> <br><i>What am I doing?</i><br> <br>She bit her lip. Her discomfort was only the fault of the fire, of course, and the boy who fed it too much wood. And perhaps a <i>bit</i> of it was owed to the memory of that other time, and that other fianc�. It had taken months of brilliant successes to persuade the papers to describe her as anything other than &#x201c;the much-beleaguered Miss M&#x2014;&#x2014;, so dreadfully disappointed by the treacherous Lord T&#x2014;&#x2014;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still, for all that she was now a shining success set to achieve her greatest triumph, this corset was strangling the life from her. And her gown, encrusted with innumerable pearls, weighed thirty pounds at the least. One might drown in such a gown! And these heeled shoes pinched her toes awfully.<br> <br>She took a deep breath. <i>This is the happiest day of my life</i>.<br> <br>Of course it was. Her feet throbbed, regardless. The stool to her right began to beckon like a siren. An <i>evil</i> siren. The bustle of her train would not survive a crushing.<br> <br>Giggles exploded from across the room. Four bridesmaids in pink and ivory ribbons clustered by the door, their noses pressed to the crack. &#x201c;Oh, Lord,&#x201d; Katherine Percy squealed. &#x201c;I <i>died</i>! She matched peacock feathers with plaid!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s appalling,&#x201d; said Lady Anne. &#x201c;One would cut her, but she&#x2019;s evidently too blind to take note of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gwen cleared her throat. &#x201c;Lady Embury has arrived?&#x201d;<br> <br>Four faces turned toward her, mouths agape. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a marvel,&#x201d; Katherine said. &#x201c;How did you guess? Yes, it was she!&#x201d;<br> <br>Gwen pressed her palm to her stomach, which was jumping so violently that it seemed a wonder her hand could not detect the commotion. She had told the baroness not to add the feathers. An entire morning they had spent designing that hat! What was the point of soliciting counsel if one refused to heed it?<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; Lucy clutched Katherine&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Look now! Gwen, your groom is passing by!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lady Anne&#x2019;s back went rigid as a poker. Gwen, meanwhile, felt a startling wave of relief. She realized that some secret part of her had been braced for another debacle like the one with Lord Trent.<br> <br>Well, perhaps her nerves would settle now. This was the day she&#x2019;d dreamed of for years. Surely she could manage to enjoy it!<br> <br>Charlotte Everdell glanced toward her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s so handsome, Gwen! Why, I think the viscount is the most attractive man in London!&#x201d;<br> <br>She managed a smile. Thomas was not <i>so</i> handsome. That word better fitted the angelic blondness of Mr. Cust, or, at the darker end of it, Alex Ramsey, whose blue eyes worked to such striking effect against his dark hair and angular cheekbones. But what of it? A wise woman did not place much import on looks. Mr. Cust, after all, was a mean-tempered scalawag, and Alex a notorious rogue; she rarely passed five minutes in his company before biting her tongue lest she reply to some rude quip in kind. Indeed, Alex proved the point: looks mattered little without a manner to match them.<br> <br>Happily, Thomas&#x2019;s manner was just like his face: pleasant through and through. He lacked a chin but made up for it with a fine beard, black as the hair on his head. His green eyes were kind and his thin lips, given to smiling. And he loved her! That was most important of all. He had told her so a hundred times. In an hour at most, she would once again have a family of her own&#x2014;a real family, not just one made of friends and paid companions.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; Katherine said. &#x201c;Boohoo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Up the aisle?&#x201d; Gwen asked softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, not yet. Oh, Gwen, what a brilliant match. I&#x2019;m so happy for you!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We all are,&#x201d; said Lucy. &#x201c;The nicest girl in England, and the handsomest heir in the realm! Why, it&#x2019;s like some fairy tale.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte clapped. &#x201c;Oh, do tell us, Gwen&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you love him <i>awfully</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course she does,&#x201d; snapped Lady Anne. &#x201c;Really, what an absurd question to ask at her wedding.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte shrank. Lucy, patting her arm, sent a knowing look to Gwen.<br> <br>Gwen pretended not to see it, but she took the meaning. Lady Anne had nursed a terrible crush on Thomas last season. She couldn&#x2019;t afford him, of course; her father&#x2019;s magnificent estates near Lincoln were as heavily mortgaged as his. But her eyes had followed him across the floor at every ball.<br> <br>Gwen felt very bad for her. Only four weeks ago, she&#x2019;d felt utterly wretched. But then she&#x2019;d learned that Lady Anne had volunteered her to knit ten sweaters for Lady Milton&#x2019;s orphanage before its spring excursion to Ramsgate. Ten sweaters in a month! Gwen was not a loom! <i>It&#x2019;s a marvelous opportunity to prove your dedication</i>, Lady Anne had told her. But this was not the first time she&#x2019;d made impossible promises on Gwen&#x2019;s behalf. Last season, shortly after Thomas had paid his first call, it had been thirty embroidered handkerchiefs for Lady Milton&#x2019;s charity bazaar, not three weeks away. It seemed clear that these sweaters were Lady Anne&#x2019;s latest attempt to sabotage Gwen&#x2019;s bid for a seat on the charity committee.<br> <br>All the same, Gwen had smiled and thanked her and put in an order for merino. Madness was forgivable in the heartbroken. (Why, after Lord Trent had jilted her, she&#x2019;d briefly taken an interest in learning <i>Latin</i>!) Still, when the newspapers claimed that she was &#x201c;everyone&#x2019;s bosom friend&#x201d; on account of her &#x201c;inborn good cheer,&#x201d; they missed how much work the position actually required&#x2014;not to mention the toll it took on her wrists.<br> <br>Perhaps, she thought, she would give up knitting after marriage.<br> <br>And embroidery, while she was at it.<br> <br>What a thrilling notion. Did she dare?<br> <br>A knock came at the door. The bridesmaids leapt back. Aunt Elma entered, smiling. When Uncle Henry appeared behind her, Gwen&#x2019;s mouth went dry. &#x201c;Is it time?&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;So it is,&#x201d; Elma said warmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come for your bridesmaids, dear.&#x201d;<br> <br>They turned to Gwen, clapping, crying out encouragement, blowing her kisses as they hurried out.<br> <br>And then the door closed, and it was only she and Uncle Henry who remained.<br> <br>Silence filled the room. Without her friends&#x2019; chatter to oppose it, the noise filtering through the door from the nave seemed much louder, like the roaring of the crowd at a circus. Surely three hundred people wasn&#x2019;t <i>that</i> many?<br> <br><i>That&#x2019;s six hundred eyes.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said brightly.<br> <br>Henry Beecham was not given to garrulity. He cleared his throat, nodded at her, ran a hand over his silver mustache, and then resumed his inspection of his shoes.<br> <br>She smiled, remembering that the first time she&#x2019;d arrived on his doorstep, he&#x2019;d greeted her just so, with a stroke of his mustache and a snuffle. His wife, Elma, had told him to say something lest Gwen think him a mute. &#x201c;All right then,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, and that had been the last Gwen had heard from him for a day or two.<br> <br>As a thirteen-year-old, she&#x2019;d found his silence quite puzzling. Frightening, even. Now, ten years later, she would not have the first idea what to do if he began to soliloquize. Call for a doctor, maybe.<br> <br>She was glad he would walk her up the aisle. Her brother had paid the Beechams to raise her, but their affection had long since grown genuine. Since Richard&#x2019;s death, they were the closest thing she had to family.<br> <br><i>But not in half an hour. By noon, I will have a real family.</i><br> <br>It would still be purchased, though.<br> <br>The thought was dark and evil and skittered across her brain like a big black beetle. She shook her head to cast it out&#x2014;mindful to do so carefully, lest she disturb the veil. This was not <i>at all</i> like the arrangement her brother had struck with the Beechams. The viscount <i>loved</i> her. And if she admired his station, that was only natural. His family tree was old and much distinguished, whereas hers . . . well, hers was more in the way of a very stumpy shrub. That it also happened to be gilded in gold&#x2014;or the dyes her father had invented; no difference, really&#x2014;made her more attractive to Thomas than she would have been otherwise. She knew that. Still, she was not <i>paying</i> him to be her husband. And as for his motives . . . well, her fortune hadn&#x2019;t persuaded Lord Trent to the altar, had it?<br> <br>&#x201c;Auspicious day,&#x201d; Henry muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked up sharply. &#x201c;Bit nervous?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her voice failed her. She nodded.<br> <br>He chuckled. &#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve seen me. Shaking in my shoes. Best man had to hold my head over a chamber pot. I&#x2019;ll tell you what he told me: &#x2018;So long as you lay the cornerstone straight, Providence will build the house.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>She managed a smile but found the adage ominous. Thomas had thirteen houses, all of them in terrible disrepair; another would only add to the expense.<br> <br>Now came another knock, and Uncle Henry straightened and extended his elbow to her. She realized only belatedly, from the pain in her loosening fingers, that she&#x2019;d been squeezing her hands into fists.<br> <br><i>But he loves me</i>, she thought. <i>That is all that matters. He loves me, and I</i> want <i>this. What was all of it for, if not for this? I&#x2019;ve wanted this forever.</i><br> <br><i>And so did Mama and Papa and Richard. They wanted this for me, too. We all did.</i><br> <br><i>I want this.</i><br> <br>She cleared her throat. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. She laid her hand on Henry&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex arrived without warning, flustering his brother&#x2019;s butler with his refusal to be announced. There was a mystery here, and in his experience, ambushes were the most expedient way to uncover the truth.<br> <br>He walked toward Gerard&#x2019;s study on legs still braced for the unsteady sway of a ship. He could smell the widow&#x2019;s perfume rising from his skin, and the scent compounded on his fatigue, making his stomach churn. The lady had slipped into his cabin last night after thirty days of idle flirtation, but this headache was enough to make him regret having entertained her. The attraction between them had been more the product of boredom than true interest. <i>What harm?</i> he&#x2019;d reasoned. Left to his own devices, he wouldn&#x2019;t have managed to sleep anyway. He barely remembered what a sound sleep felt like.<br> <br>Odd to think that the insomnia had seemed a blessing, at first. So much useful time no longer squandered on unconsciousness. But after five months, the nights were beginning to stretch into dry-eyed eternities. The widow&#x2019;s company had not made the time pass more quickly for him.<br> <br>At least her perfume would lend him the illusion of having bathed.<br> <br>As he turned the corner, he willed himself to focus on the task at hand. It would be convenient to find an obvious explanation for his brother&#x2019;s actions, but nothing in the house spoke of want. The threadbare Aubussons had not been replaced by newer, plusher, cheaper rugs. The wallpaper bore no darkened patches where frames had been removed. In the box stalls in the mews, which he had checked upon arrival, a new pair of chestnuts now gave company to the matched grays. The carriages showed no signs of neglect. Everything looked exactly the same, which made Gerry&#x2019;s decision all the more baffling.<br> <br>The door to the study stood open. For an uncanny second, as Alex paused in the doorway, he had a sense of looking onto a scene long dead: his father, sitting ramrod-straight at his desk, industriously scrutinizing the household accounts. With the d�j� vu came other, equally dead impulses&#x2014;to stay quiet; to walk on by; to avoid a fight that could not be won. The weariness that touched him was not all from the insomnia, nor the long journey either. As a boy, he&#x2019;d had to work very hard to believe in possibilities.<br> <br>He exhaled. It was only Gerard at the desk, of course. His older brother was the picture of the Earl of Weston before him, lantern-jawed and stocky, as well-fleshed as a bull. Came home more frequently in the evenings, though. And there were other small differences&#x2014;such as the fact that their father would have shot himself before surrendering any title to family land.<br> <br>Of course, it would have been a waste of a bullet, in Alex&#x2019;s view. He had no interest in the patrimony. It wasn&#x2019;t his, anyway.<br> <br><i>Why the bloody hell am I here, then?</i><br> <br>He sighed. He was heartily sick of this question, having asked it of himself all the way from Gibraltar. Little else to do in the early hours before dawn. Best answer: his sisters had asked it of him. It would be his favor to them, then&#x2014;enough to purchase twelve months&#x2019; freedom from additional pestering. &#x201c;Cheers,&#x201d; he said from the doorway.<br> <br>Gerard looked up. &#x201c;What&#x2014;Alex!&#x201d; He started to rise, then caught himself. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re back! We had no idea!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Neither did I,&#x201d; said Alex. &#x201c;A sudden decision when I reached Gibraltar. The whole place reeks of blood pudding&#x2014;brought the motherland to mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>In fact, he&#x2019;d received several telegrams during his stop there: two outraged screeds from his sisters, and a half-dozen cautions from friends who had seen Christopher Monsanto dining in Buenos Aires with the Peruvian trade minister. It seemed that the Yank now had his overbearing eye on Alex&#x2019;s contracts with the Peruvian government.<br> <br>The thought seemed to add weight to his exhaustion. He would probably regret not having turned back for Lima at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well.&#x201d; Gerry was making a swift, critical inspection, his gaze raking Alex from head to toe. &#x201c;I must say, this is a splendid surprise.&#x201d;<br> <br>As always, the inspection grated. As always, Alex produced a smile. &#x201c;Will I live?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Or does the deathbed draw nigh?&#x201d;<br> <br>His brother had the grace to redden. &#x201c;You look whole enough. Do sit, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex picked up an armchair on his way across the carpet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; Gerry said sharply. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s heavy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sweet Christ. Alex dropped the chair in front of the desk and took his seat. &#x201c;It weighs no more than a ten year old,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Really, Gerry, has it escaped your notice that I outstrip you by a head?&#x201d; Since his fourteenth birthday, he&#x2019;d been outrunning and outfighting his brother in any number of arenas. But if he picked up a toy poodle, Gerry would probably feel the need to call out a warning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bulk, not height,&#x201d; Gerry said critically. &#x201c;Bulk is what matters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex eyed his brother&#x2019;s ever-expanding gut. &#x201c;Yes, I suppose that&#x2019;s one view of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You look as if you could use a meal.

The victim, like three others before him at the asylum in recent months, was killed with the infamous "Punjab lasso," the murder weapon of the Phantom of the Opera.</p><p>Certain of Robbie's innocence, they begin an investigation with the help of Detective Riordan. Will has himself committed to the asylum to investigate from the inside, and Elizabeth volunteers at Eloise and questions people outside the asylum. While Will endures horrific conditions in his search for the killer, Elizabeth and Riordan follow the trail of a murder suspect all the way to Kalamazoo, where they realize the killer might still be at Eloise, putting Will in extreme danger. They race back to Detroit, but will they arrive in time to save Will and bring the killer to justice?</p><p>Filled with Johnson's trademark roller-coaster plot, nuanced characters, and brilliant historical research, <i>Detroit Breakdown</i> is a compelling, dark mystery set in the once- flourishing Paris of the West.</p></p><p><p>D. E. Johnson, a graduate of Central Michigan University, is a history buff who has been writing fiction since childhood. He comes by his interest in automotive history through his grandfather, who was the vice president of Checker Motors.

Come on.&#x201d;<br>I stood at the side of her father&#x2019;s old desk, staring after her into the narrow passageway behind the bookcase. The unfinished boards and timbers contrasted with the smooth walnut inside the den. &#x201c;Just a minute.&#x201d; I tried to drum up some courage, but it wasn&#x2019;t coming.<br>&#x201c;Will!&#x201d; Elizabeth called. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br>I took a deep breath, stepped through the door into the passageway, and took four sideways steps before I froze. Sawn timbers pressed against my back, the wall in front of me only inches from my face. There was just enough light to see the murky gray of the raw wood and the ends of nails protruding through the boards in front of me. Droplets of sweat slid down my forehead into my eyes. Beneath my suit coat, my shirt was already soaked. Beads of sweat smeared from my knees to my trousers. I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. My heart pounded in my ears.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t...&#x201d; I hurried back toward the light of the den.<br>&#x201c;Will?&#x201d; Elizabeth called again as I stepped through the door.<br>Safely back in what had been her father&#x2019;s den, I bent over, gloved hands on knees, and panted, wrenching my thoughts into the present by focusing on the pain in my right hand and shoulder. The nerves in my hand still sent out messages to my brain that they were burning, even though it had been a year and a half since the acid scorched me. The shoulder was a newer pain, a bullet wound from the Gianolla gang. To be fair, I&#x2019;d shot two of them first.<br>Elizabeth stuck her head into the room. &#x201c;Will? What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br>I straightened and shrugged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s too close in there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s right around the corner. You were nearly to the room.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no other way to get there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it, Elizabeth.&#x201d; I reached over and took her hand. &#x201c;I want to, but I can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s the dreams.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Her face fell. &#x201c;The trunk?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. I didn&#x2019;t want to worry you.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d never been claustrophobic, never thought twice about plunging into tight spaces, but an incident earlier in the year had changed that. I&#x2019;d been kidnapped and twice stuffed inside a steamer trunk. At the time, it was nothing more than uncomfortable, but the experience lived on in my nightmares. I wake inside the trunk. The air is stifling, and it&#x2019;s blazing hot. I&#x2019;m squeezed inside, unable to move at all. With a certainty I seldom feel, I know I will die. The air thins. I try to conserve my energy, but I can&#x2019;t stop myself from gasping in as much air as I can. I hear nothing other than my ragged breathing. Just when my lungs can take no more, I wake myself with a scream of terror.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; She stepped close to me and cupped my cheek in her hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve looked&nbsp;... I wondered if you&#x2019;ve been sleeping. Are you having them every night?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; I fell into one of the club chairs opposite the desk.<br>Elizabeth sat beside me and took my hand again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, my darling.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing all right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Most of the time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine. The hidden room isn&#x2019;t going anywhere. I just thought you&#x2019;d find it interesting.&#x201d;<br>No one, not even her mother, had known about the room. Her father had had it secretly built when the house was constructed. A few days earlier, Helga, the Humes&#x2019; maid, had found the hidden door while cleaning and alerted Elizabeth. She searched the room and found piles of cash and documents incriminating some of her father&#x2019;s co-conspirators, most of whom had died at roughly the same time he had. She&#x2019;d already given the money to charity and burned the papers.<br>Finally calm again, I breathed more easily. &#x201c;Lord,&#x201d; I said, feeling my shirt stick to my back. &#x201c;I need a bath.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take one?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to leave already, Lizzie. I&#x2019;ll never get back on your calendar.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Anyway, you can take one here.&#x201d; Her tone became playful. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t even make you use the servants&#x2019; bathroom.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a change of clothes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, but you do. I haven&#x2019;t made it to the mission yet.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;d given her a pile of clothing for the McGregor Mission, one of the many charitable organizations she supported. &#x201c;Well, I suppose...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to make it worth your while.&#x201d; She leaned over and kissed me. With a giggle, she said, &#x201c;Your mustache tickles.&#x201d;<br>I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d ever heard her giggle. I&#x2019;d been working on a beard and mustache for about a week, and the results thus far were not promising. The mustache was coming in well enough, but the beard was thin, particularly on my cheeks. I thought I should probably shave it and just try for the mustache, but beards were fashionable. I didn&#x2019;t want to give up so easily.<br>I stood and pulled Elizabeth to her feet, noticing for the millionth time how beautiful she was. Sometimes she took me by surprise; her eyes green as holly, her high cheekbones and full lips, her beautiful auburn hair, short now. Each feature&#x2014;lovely, but they added together in some exponential equation that ended in perfection. &#x201c;I love you so much,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I want you all to myself.&#x201d;<br>She pecked me on the lips. &#x201c;And you know I love you. But you also know I have my work. Once the election is past, my time will be free.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I doubt it. They won&#x2019;t let you go.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be nothing left to do. We&#x2019;ll have the vote.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; I replied.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no &#x2018;perhaps.&#x2019; We&#x2019;re leading everywhere.&#x201d; She turned and headed for the door. &#x201c;Now come and take a bath, smelly. Everyone&#x2019;s asleep. We&#x2019;ve got all night.&#x201d;<br>I arched my eyebrows. &#x201c;Would you care to join me?&#x201d;<br>Her eyes bulged, and her mouth formed a perfect circle. &#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;What if my mother&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped when she saw my smile. &#x201c;Oh, you are such a goop. Now go.&#x201d;<br>The bell on the telephone jangled, startling us both. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t answer it,&#x201d; I said. I could feel our evening disappearing into smoke.<br>The phone rang again.<br>Elizabeth looked toward the doorway and back at me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll wake my mother.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to be a wrong number. Who would call this late?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Someone with bad news, that&#x2019;s who,&#x201d; she said.<br>The phone kept ringing.<br>&#x201c;Then let it ring.&#x201d;<br>She made up her mind and strode to the desk, picked up the candlestick of the telephone, and put the receiver to her ear. &#x201c;Hume residence.&#x201d; As she listened to the reply, little furrows appeared between her eyebrows and began to deepen. &#x201c;Elizabeth.&#x201d; She listened again. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m her daughter. Who is&#x2014;&#x201d; A pause. &#x201c;Wait&#x2014;Robert Clarke, you said?&#x201d;<br>Robert Clarke was a cousin of Elizabeth&#x2019;s who had spent his life at Eloise Hospital&#x2014;the Wayne County insane asylum. I wouldn&#x2019;t have known that had her mother not gone to Eloise fairly frequently to visit him. I&#x2019;d occasionally asked Elizabeth about Robert, but she always changed the subject. I stopped asking a long time ago.<br>I heard a muffled voice on the other end of the line but couldn&#x2019;t understand it.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there as soon as I can.&#x201d;<br>She started to hang up, but stopped and listened. &#x201c;About&nbsp;... half an hour?&#x201d; Pause. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure <i>exactly</i> when. I&#x2019;ll hurry.&#x201d; She slammed the receiver onto the hook and turned to me. &#x201c;Could I borrow your motorcar?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, but why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;... a problem I have to deal with.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;At Eloise?&#x201d;<br>She gave me a tight nod.<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you let me drive? I can see you&#x2019;re upset.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. That&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; Her words were short, clipped.<br>This was not like her at all. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;<br>She glared at me. &#x201c;Can I borrow the automobile or not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. But let me come.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Damn it, Will&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped herself. Her eyes shifted from right to left, and then she looked at me again. &#x201c;All right. Go start it. We have to leave now.&#x201d;<br>While I&#x2019;d never seen Elizabeth act this way, it was obvious the phone call had shaken her to the core, so I decided to hold my questions until we were under way. I ran out of the den, down the hall, and out the door to my Model T Torpedo parked at the curb. The sweat that covered me chilled in the cool of the early August night. I set the spark and throttle, ran around to the front, and cranked the starter. The front door burst open, and Elizabeth ran down the steps. When the engine caught, we climbed into the car. Across the street, the Detroit River burbled and surged.<br>&#x201c;Hurry,&#x201d; Elizabeth said. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br>With a sense of foreboding, I made a U-turn and headed west on Jefferson. The wind blew through my wet clothing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s on Michigan Avenue, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;d never been to Eloise, and the thought of the place gave me the willies. Worse, I was certain the telephone call had ended the magical time Elizabeth and I had had over the las...</p><h2>Mahler: A Biography</h2><p>The focus is on Mahler&#x2019;s last decade, his tempestuous marriage to the alluring Alma Schindler, his work as a "summer composer" in isolated huts in the country, his revolutionary achievements as director of the Vienna opera and his final years in America. But it sets the stage by looking into Mahler&#x2019;s earlier career as a talented, ambitious, and often ruthless conductor. In her memoirs Alma drew Mahler as a sickly, cerebral recluse. Arnold Schoenberg called him a "saint." Leonard Bernstein, largely responsible for the Mahler "boom" in the Sixties, found a "secret shame" at the heart of Mahler&#x2019;s music, "the shame of being a Jew and the shame of being ashamed." Jonathan Carr looks behind these myths, and using letters, diaries, and other material hitherto unavailable in English, he brilliantly challenges some of the most widely held assumptions about Mahler.</p><p>Evaluating with exemplary judiciousness the masses of material about Gustav Mahler (1860-1911), British journalist Jonathan Carr pens a highly readable biography. Whether describing the composer&#39;s youth in Central Europe, triumphs as a conductor in Vienna and New York, or stormy marriage to Alma Schindler, Carr elucidates Mahler&#39;s complex nature without presuming to &#34;explain&#34; it. Devilish or saintly? Cunning or naive? Extrovert or withdrawn? &#34;He was all these things,&#34; writes Carr, &#34;brandishing his contradictions in music of stinging intensity.&#34; Mahler&#39;s compositions and personality gain new dimensions from this fresh, nuanced approach.Jonathan Carr was a former bureau chief of the Financial Times and The Economist. His other books include biographies of Helmut Schmidt and Gustav Mahler.</p><h2>Beginning at Moses: A Guide to Finding Christ in the Old Testament</h2><p>Although not in every line and perhaps not on every page, the message of Christ overshadows the entire Old Testament.

Beginning at Moses seeks to follow the example of Christ Himself Who, &#34;beginning at Moses and all the prophets,&#34; expounded from all the Scripture the things concerning Himself.</p><p>Dr. Michael P.

This volume gathers well-known thinkers from a breadth of confessional Christian traditions who share a passionate interest in better understanding the nature of persons. The contributors to Personal Identity in Theological Perspective aim to recover the ancient biblical account of human beings as made &#34;in the image of God.&#34; Their essays fall naturally into three divisions - retrieving historical discussions of human identity, presenting contemporary challenges to a distinctively Christian anthropology, and offering constructive proposals toward a richer understanding of persons. This volume will provoke discussion and debate on the fundamental question What does it mean to be human? Contributors: Stanley J. Grenz Michael S. Horton Stanton L. Jones David H.

Mark R Talbot is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Wheaton Collgege, Illinois and coeditor of Limning the Psyche.J. P. Moreland -- Tallbot School of Theology, Biola University &#34;Facts about human persons have proven to be recalcitrant for postmodern and naturalist worldviews, as Christians would suspect. An adequate treatment of human persons simply cannot be given without the aid of Christian theology, especially in light of the nature and importance of the doctrine of the image of God. Thus it is refreshing to see such a team of scholars weigh in on the anthropological debate. Personal Identity in Theological Perspective combines a breadth of coverage with a depth of analysis. It is an important contribution to the ongoing conversation.&#34; Paul Helm -- University of London &#34;This collection of historical and contemporary essays informs, provokes, and consoles. Its diversity is informed by the conviction that the nature of humanity is grounded in the nature of God. It is therefore theological in the purest sense.&#34; Paul F. M. Zahl -- Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry &#34;In a period when the achievement of one&#39;s personal identity appears to be the value for all of us, these unified and meaty essays on identity in Christian context are apt in the extreme. Strikingly and originally, Stanton Jones and Mark Yarhouse have hit the ball straight out of the park! Their contribution concerning sexual identity and sexual ethics is by itself sufficient to drive the book to a very wide readership.&#34; John Cooper -- Calvin Theological Seminary &#34;Personal Identity in Theological Perspective is an excellent example of contemporary Christian scholarship. This collection of essays by evangelical and confessional academics insightfully and creatively engages contemporary discussions of human nature from perspectives shaped by the great theological traditions of historic Christianity. The authors relate theological topics such as the image of God and the body-soul relation to current views of human biology, psychology, sexuality, community, culture, morality, and religion as they wrestle with what it means to be a human person. This volume would make excellent collateral reading for seminary courses in theological anthropology&#34;</p><h2>The Republic</h2><p>Written by Plato around 380 BC. The Republic concerns itself with justice, order and character of the city states. Being Plato&#39;s best know work it has an great historical influence on philosophy. Socrates talks about justice and if just men are happier then the unjust. With discussions on the immortality of the soul and philosophers role in society.</p><p>In this influential two-volume edition, first published in 1902, the Scottish classicist James Adam examines the text of Plato&#39;s monumental political and philosophical dialogue. Volume 2 focuses on Books 6-10, which discuss the place of the philosopher and questions of governance.<p>This celebrated philosophical work of the fourth century B.C. contemplates the elements of an ideal state, serving as the forerunner for such other classics of political thought as Cicero's <i>De Republica</i>, St. Augustine's <i>City of God</i>, and Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i>.<br>Written in the form of a dialog in which Socrates questions his students and fellow citizens, <i>The Republic</i> concerns itself chiefly with the question, "What is justice?" as well as Plato's theory of ideas and his conception of the philosopher's role in society. To explore the latter, he invents the allegory of the cave to illustrate his notion that ordinary men are like prisoners in a cave, observing only the shadows of things, while philosophers are those who venture outside the cave and see things as they really are, and whose task it is to return to the cave and tell the truth about what they have seen. This dynamic metaphor expresses at once the eternal conflict between the world of the senses (the cave) and the world of ideas (the world outside the cave), and the philosopher's role as mediator between the two.</p><p></p></p><h2>Horace Greeley: Champion of American Freedom</h2><p><p>From his arrival in New York City in 1831 as a young printer from New Hampshire to his death in 1872 after losing the presidential election to General Ulysses S. Grant, Horace Greeley (b. 1811) was a quintessential New Yorker. He thrived on the city&#x2019;s ceaseless energy, with his <em>New York Tribune</em> at the forefront of a national revolution in reporting and transmitting news. Greeley devoured ideas, books, fads, and current events as quickly as he developed his own interests and causes, all of which revolved around the concept of freedom. While he adored his work as a New York editor, Greeley&#x2019;s lifelong quest for universal freedom took him to the edge of the American frontier and beyond to Europe. A major figure in nineteenth-century American politics and reform movements, Greeley was also a key actor in a worldwide debate about the meaning of freedom that involved progressive thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic, including Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Karl Marx.</p><p>Greeley was first and foremost an ardent nationalist who devoted his life to ensuring that America live up to its promises of liberty and freedom for all of its members. Robert C. Williams places Greeley&#x2019;s relentless political ambitions, bold reform agenda, and complex personal life into the broader context of freedom. <strong>Horace Greeley</strong> is as rigorous and vast as Greeley himself, and as America itself in the long nineteenth century.</p><p>In the first comprehensive biography of Greeley to be published in nearly half a century, Williams captures Greeley from all sides: editor, reformer, political candidate, eccentric, and trans-Atlantic public intellectual; examining headlining news issues of the day, including slavery, westward expansion, European revolutions, the Civil War, the demise of the Whig and the birth of the Republican parties, transcendentalism, and other intellectual currents of the era.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert C. Williams</b> is Vail Professor of History Emeritus at Davidson College and lecturer in history at Bates College. His books include <i>Klaus Fuchs: Atom Spy</i>; <i>Russian Art and American Money, 1900-1940</i>; and <i>The American Atom: A Documentary History of Nuclear Energy</i> (with Philip Cantelon). He lives in Center Lovell, Maine.</p>Surveying the astounding range of Horace Greeley's engagement in the public life of the mid-nineteenth century-the important role he played in progressive movements from temperance and Fourierism to emancipation and land reform; his establishment of capitalist utopian communities in New York, Colorado, and North Carolina; and his influence on politics and popular opinion through his thirty-year editorship of the New York Tribune-historian Williams emphasizes a common theme: Greeley dedicated his life to promoting freedom. In this, as in his casual racism and misogyny, he was a man of his age, a period when the proper meaning of freedom was the subject of intense public debate and, ultimately, war. The book accordingly tells Greeley's story through snapshots of the period and its prevailing passions, interspersed with contemporary comments by and about Greeley; the result is a brisk tour of the newspaperman's life and times that often avoids objective assessment or insight into the inner man. Williams' and Greeley's reflections on the republican ideals that rocked the world during the latter's lifetime are intriguing, but brief discussions of topics like Greeley's strained but crucial relationship with Abraham Lincoln leave the reader wishing for a closer look.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

George Oppen's <i>New Collected Poems</i> gathers in one volume all of the poems published in books during his lifetime (1908-84), as well as previously uncollected poems and also a selection of his unpublished work. Oppen, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969, has long been acknowledged as one of America's foremost modernists. A member of the Objectivist group that flourished in the 1930s (which also included William Carlos Williams, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, and Louis Zukofsky), he was hailed by Ezra Pound as "a serious craftsman, a sensibility which is not every man's sensibility and which has not been got out of any other man's book." Oppen's <i>New Collected Poems</i> (which replaces New Direction's earlier, smaller <i>Collected Poems</i> of 1975) is edited by Michael Davidson of the University of California at San Diego, who also writes an introduction to the poet's life and work and supplies generous notes that will give interested readers an understanding of the background of the individual books as well as references in the poems.</p><p><b>George Oppen</b> was born in Rochester, New York. His first book of poems, <i>Discrete Series</i>, was published in 1934 by The Objectivist Press, after which he stopped writing poetry for nearly twenty-five years in favor of political activism, even living as an exile in Mexico in the 1950s, during the McCarthy era.

Mentally, she was about three, and the experts cautioned her parents against hoping for any serious improvement. No one knew what had gone wrong with Jeri. There was no history of mental defects on either side of her family and no apparent cause. She had two younger brothers, both of whom were quite normal.</p><p>Her father was a border patrolman, her mother a former legal secretary who had given up all hope of a career when she followed her husband to Fort Moxie.</p><p>Jeri went to school in Walhalla, which conducted the only local special-education class. She enjoyed the school, where she made numerous friends and where everyone seemed to make a fuss over her. Mornings in the Tully household were underscored by Jeri&#x2019;s enthusiasm to get moving.</p><p>Walhalla was thirty-five miles away. The family had an arrangement with the school district, which was spread out over too vast an area to operate buses for the special-education kids: The Tullys provided their own transportation, and the district absorbed the expenses.</p><p>Jeri&#x2019;s mother had actually grown to enjoy the daily round-trip. The child loved to ride, and she was never happier than when in the car. The other half of the drive, when Mom was alone, served as a quiet time, when she could just watch the long fields roll by, or plug an audio book into the system.</p><p>Jeri&#x2019;s father worked the midnight shift that night, and his wife was waiting for him when he got home in the morning with French toast, bacon, and coffee. While they were at breakfast, an odd thing happened. For the only time in her life, Jeri wandered away from home. It seemed, later, that she had decided to go to school and, having no concept of distance, had begun walking.</p><p>Unseen by anyone except a two-year-old brother, she put on her overshoes and her coat, let herself out through the porch door, walked up to Route 11, and turned right. Her house was on the extreme western edge of town, so she got past the demolished Dairy Queen and across the interstate overpass within minutes. The temperature, which is exceedingly erratic in April, had fallen back into the teens.</p><p>Three-quarters of a mile outside Fort Moxie, Route 11 curves sharply south and almost immediately veers west again. Had the road been free of snow, Jeri would probably have stayed with the highway and been picked up within a few minutes. But a light snowfall had dusted the highway. She wasn&#x2019;t used to paying attention to details and, at the first bend, she walked straight off the road. When, a few minutes later, the snow got deeper, she angled right and got still farther away.</p><p>Jeri&#x2019;s parents had by then discovered she was missing. A frightened search was just getting started, but it was limited to within a block or so of her home.</p><p>Jim Stuyvesant, the editor and publisher of the <i>Fort Moxie News</i>, was on his way to the Roundhouse. Rumors that an apparition had come through from the other side were going to be denied that morning in a press conference, and Jim planned to be there. He was just west of town when he saw movement out on Josh McKenzie&#x2019;s land to his right: A small whirlwind was gliding back and forth in a curiously regular fashion. The wind phenomenon was a perfect whirlpool, narrow at the base, wide at the top. Usually, these things were blurred around the edges, and they floated erratically across the plain. But this one looked almost solid, and it moved methodically back and forth along a narrow track.</p><p>Stuyvesant pulled off the road and stopped to watch.</p><p>It was almost hypnotic. A stiff blast of air rocked the car, enough to blow the small whirlwind to pieces. But it remained intact.</p><p>Stuyvesant never traveled without his video camera, which he had used on several occasions to get material he&#x2019;d subsequently sold to <i>Ben at Ten</i> or to one of the other local TV news shows. (He had, for example, got superb footage of the Thanksgiving Day pileup on I-29, and the blockade of imported beef at the border port by angry ranchers last summer.) The floater continued to glide back and forth in its slow, unwavering pattern. He turned on the camera, walked a few steps into the field, and started to record.</p><p>He used the zoom lens to get close and got a couple of minutes&#x2019; worth before the whirlwind seemed to pause.</p><p>It started toward him.</p><p>He kept filming.</p><p>It approached at a constant pace. There was something odd in its manner, something almost deliberate.</p><p>A sudden burst of wind out of the north ripped at his jacket but didn&#x2019;t seem to have any effect on the thing. Stuyvesant&#x2019;s instincts began to sound warnings, and he took a step back toward the car.</p><p>It stopped. Remained still in the middle of the field.</p><p>Amazing. As if it had responded to him.</p><p>He stood, uncertain how to proceed. It began to move again, laterally. It retreated a short distance, then came forward again to its previous position.</p><p>He watched it through the camera lens. The red indicator lamp glowed at the bottom of the picture.</p><p>You&#x2019;re waiting for me.</p><p>It approached again, and a sudden burst of wind tugged at his collar and his hair.</p><p>He took a step forward. And it retreated.</p><p>Like everyone else in the Fort Moxie area, Stuyvesant had been deluged with fantastic tales and theories since the Roundhouse had been uncovered, with its pathways to other worlds. Now, without prompting, he wondered whether a completely unknown type of life-form existed on the prairie and was revealing itself to him. He laughed at the idea. And began to wonder what he really believed.</p><p>He started forward.</p><p>It withdrew before him, matching his pace.</p><p>He kept going. The snow got deeper, filled his shoes, and froze his ankles.</p><p>It hovered before him. He hoped he was getting the effect on camera.</p><p>It whirled and glittered in the sun, maintaining its distance. He stopped, and it stopped. He started again, and it matched him.</p><p>Another car was slowing down, pulling off the highway. He wondered how he would explain this, and immediately visualized next week&#x2019;s headline in the <i>News</i>: MAD EDITOR PUT UNDER GUARD.</p><p>But it was a hunt without a point. The fields went on, all the way to Winnipeg. Far enough, he decided. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, aloud. &#x201c;This is as far as I go.&#x201d;</p><p>And the thing withdrew another sixty or so yards. And collapsed.</p><p>When it did, it revealed something dark lying in the snow.</p><p>Jeri Tully.</p><p>That was the day Stuyvesant got religion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>O&#x2019;er the hills and far away.</p><p>&#x2014;Thomas D&#x2019;Urfey, <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>, 1719</p><p>EVEN THOUGH HE&#x2019;D seen the eerie green glow atop the mountain almost every night on TV, Brad Hollister was still surprised that evening as the hills got out of the way, and he saw it for the first time through his windshield. It was easy to understand why people had panicked a few weeks earlier, had thought it was radioactivity and fled the area. They were mostly back now, of course, assured by official sources that the radiation was not hazardous. The world had been shocked when a structure thousands of years old had been excavated on the Sioux reservation near Devils Lake in North Dakota. And shocked again when, a few days later, it began to emit that soft green light. And completely rattled when investigators discovered it was a star gate. That was the capability, of course, that stayed in the headlines. And kept the phones ringing at <i>Grand Forks Live</i>, Brad&#x2019;s call-in show on KLYM.</p><p>Scientific teams had been transported to three locations, a garden world that the media immediately branded &#x201c;Eden,&#x201d; a second location that seemed to be nothing more than a series of passageways in a structure that had no windows, and a deserted space station that appeared to be located outside the Milky Way.</p><p>Missions were going out regularly, mostly to Eden and the station. A team of eight journalists, accompanied by two Sioux security escorts, were on Eden now, expected to return that evening. And a group of scientists were scheduled to head for the same destination within the hour. Brad&#x2019;s callers wanted him to make the trip, and he&#x2019;d been assuring them he would eventually. But before he climbed onto the circular stone, with its gridwork surface, and allowed them to send him off to another world, he wanted to <i>watch </i>the operation. Not that he was scared.</p><p>The emerald glow brightened as he drew near on Route 32. Eventually, he turned off onto a side road, cleared a police unit, and began the long climb to the summit. A bright moon hung over the sparse land, and a bitter wind rocked the car. Eventually, as he approached the summit, the Roundhouse became visible. A bubble dome, it stood on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the vast sweep of land that had once contained Lake Agassiz. Thousands of years ago, Agassiz had covered most of North Dakota and a large section of Canada.</p><p>The building lay below the level of the surrounding granite. Someone had gouged a space in the rock to make room for the Roundhouse. Brad&#x2019;s callers were entranced by the theory that the construction had been orchestrated to place the star gate level with the ancient shoreline. Curved struts anchored it in the rock. The surface resembled a beveled emerald plastic.</p><p>It was surrounded by several temporary structures, which had been erected to support the science teams and the security effort. The area was sealed off by a wired fence. A gateway provided access to cars and trucks.</p><p>The gates were down. Brad lowered his window as he pulled alongside the security booth. A young man in a dark blue Sioux uniform looked out.</p><p>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Hollister,&#x201d; Brad said, handing over his driver&#x2019;s license. &#x201c;They know I&#x2019;m coming.&#x201d;</p><p>The officer checked the ID, touched a computer screen, nodded, and gave it back. &#x201c;Okay, Mr. Hollister,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Park wherever you like.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>A SECURITY GUARD opened the front door for him. He proceeded down a short passageway, past several doors, and entered the dome. This would have been the place that filled with water at high tide, allowing the occupants to take a boat out onto Lake Agassiz. That, of course, was very likely the boat found recently buried on Tom Lasker&#x2019;s farm, which had led to the discovery.</p><p>There were about twenty people, plus three or four uniformed security guards, standing around talking, a few seated at a table. Most were casually dressed, as if preparing for a camping trip. There was also a TV team. A second entrance opened into the chamber from the far side, where everyone was gathered. During the Agassiz years, it would have provided the access for the incoming tide. It had also been, according to the experts, the preferred entrance for the original occupants, the front door, looking out onto a beach. April Cannon was near the transporter, talking with a reporter. The transporter consisted of a circular grid, large enough to have supported Lasker&#x2019;s boat, and a control device, mounted several feet away on the wall.</p><p>April had been the source of his invitation to come in and watch. Brad had known her a long time. She held a doctorate in biochemistry and was a director for Colson Labs, the last time he&#x2019;d looked. She&#x2019;d been conscripted by Sioux Chairman James Walker to coordinate the off-world missions, and, as she put it, that had overwhelmed everything else in her life. April had been a guest on <i>Grand Forks Live </i>a couple of times. When she saw him come in, she excused herself and started in his direction.</p><p>April was an attractive young African-American, with her hair draped around her shoulders, animated features, scintillating eyes, and a persuasive manner. Brad had always suspected that, had she gone into sales instead of chemistry, she would have been wealthy by then. &#x201c;Perfect timing, Brad,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got some people coming in any minute now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, April. Where are they now? Eden?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. They&#x2019;re all media types. After they get back, we&#x2019;ll be sending out a team of scientists. Biologists and astronomers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have they figured out where the place is yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Maybe we&#x2019;ll get lucky, and they&#x2019;ll do it tonight.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;We know it&#x2019;s pretty far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess it would have to be.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed. And turned away. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s starting.&#x201d; The front area, near the transport device, brightened though Brad could see no source for the light. &#x201c;Anyway, glad to see you, Brad,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The show&#x2019;s about to start.&#x201d; She went back to the transporter and joined one of the Sioux, who seemed to be in charge of overseeing the recovery process. A wave of excitement swept through the crowd. A few people started moving closer to the stone grid. The security guards moved in to keep them at a distance.</p><p>A TV camera approached, and its lights went on. The illumination was directly over the grid. It expanded into a cloud, and Brad thought he could see something moving inside it. Everybody was leaning forward.</p><p>The light kept getting brighter. The cloud enveloped the grid. Then it stalled and simply floated there, so bright it was difficult to look at. And, finally, it began to fade.</p><p>It left someone standing on the grid. A young woman in a security uniform. &#x201c;Welcome home, Andrea,&#x201d; said April, as the cloud disappeared.</p><p>It was Andrea Hawk, who, like Brad, ran a call-in show when she wasn&#x2019;t on duty at the Roundhouse. She got some applause, waved to the audience, and stepped quickly out of the way. Moments later, the light was back.</p><p>Another woman, this time in fatigues, wearing a knapsack and a hat that would have made Indiana Jones proud, emerged. &#x201c;Aleen Rynsburger,&#x201d; said a guy standing off to one side. Brad knew the name. She was a <i>Washington Post </i>columnist.</p><p>One by one they came back, seven reporters and one more security escort. All with wide-brimmed hats. He was relieved to see the process didn&#x2019;t look like a big deal. The light comes on, and somebody steps out and waves to the a...</p></p><h2>Personal record, 1920-1972</h2><p>First U.S. edition.

However, most Melville scholars consider it his most sophisticated work, and many, such as novelist Ralph Ellison, have hailed it as the most piercing look at slavery in all of American literature.<br><br> Based on a real life incident&#x2014;the character names remain unchanged&#x2014;<i>Benito Cereno</i> tells what happens when an American merchant ship comes upon a mysterious Spanish ship where the nearly all-black crew and their white captain are starving and yet hostile to offers of help. Melville's most focused political work, it is rife with allusions (a ship named after Santo Domingo, site of the slave revolt led by Toussaint L'Ouverture), analogies (does the good-hearted yet obtuse American captain refer to the American character itself?), and mirroring images that deepen our reflections on human oppression and its resultant depravities.<br><br> It is, in short, a multi-layered masterpiece that rewards repeated readings, and deepens our appreciation of Melville's genius.<br><br> <b>The Art of The Novella Series<br><br> </b>Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.</p><p><b>Herman Melville</b> was born in New York City in 1819. At 18 he set sail on a whaler, and upon his return, wrote a series of bestselling adventure novels based on his travels, including <i>Typee and Omoo</i>, which made him famous. Starting with <i>Moby Dick</i> in 1851, however, his increasingly complex and challenging work drew more and more negative criticism, until 1857 when, after his collection <i>Piazza Tales</i> (which included "Bartleby the Scrivener"), and the novel <i>The Confidence Man</i>, Melville stopped publishing fiction. He drifted into obscurity, writing poetry and working for the Customs House in New York City, until his death in 1891."I wanted them all, even those I'd already read."<br> <b>&#x2014;Ron Rosenbaum, <i>The New York Observer</i></b><br><br> "Small wonders."<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Time Out London</i></b><br><br> <i>"</i>[F]irst-rate...astutely selected and attractively packaged...indisputably great works."<br> <b>&#x2014;Adam Begley, <i>The New York Observer</i></b><br><br> "I&#x2019;ve always been haunted by Bartleby, the proto-slacker.

Each book in the Biography from Ancient Civilizations series offers a brief, fairly fast-moving account of the subject. Because so little is known of Homer's life, Tracy's book relies on legends from ancient sources, and at times, young readers may find it difficult to separate fact from fiction. For instance, a page listing Greek heroes blends the mythological and historical (Pericles follows Perseus). More is documented on the life of Alexander the Great, and Bankston makes an effort to name the sources of some of the familiar stories about the world conqueror. Most of the illustrations in both books are reproductions of paintings or engravings from the baroque period or from Roman wall paintings. Each book concludes with a time line, chapter notes, a chronology, a short glossary, and a bibliography (including Web sites). Libraries with a lot on the subjects can probably pass over these, but some students will appreciate the brevity of each of these biographies. <i>Todd Morning</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Linguistics, the discipline which studies the structure, function and phenomena of language, has uncovered many surprising and fascinating things about the nature of our human language faculty. But these findings are often presented in opaque technical terminology which hides their simplicity and beauty. &#34;Intoducing Linguistics&#34; demystifies the subject, presenting a clear account of what linguists do, how they go about it, and what they have achieved so far. A summary of the history of linguistics, from Aristotle to Chomsky, includes the chief contributions of its leading figures - Saussure, the Prague Circle, the American structuralists, Sapir, Bloomfield and others. Illustrated by Bill Mayblin, this book provides a review of the most recent and dramatic advances in the field, such as first-language acquisition by children, language in the brain, sign languages, language change and linguistic prehistory, men&#39;s and women&#39;s language, language engineering and the universal properties of languages. Here is the ideal companion to related titles in this series on Chomsky, semiotics, mind and brain and consciousness.</p><p>R. L. Trask was a professor of Linguistics at the University of Sussex.</p><h2>Something in the Air: American Passion and Defiance in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics</h2><p><i>Something in the Air</i> is Richard Hoffer&#x2019;s gripping sports narrative that tells the individual stories of the athletes who gathered in Mexico City in 1968, a year of dramatic upheaval around the world. Racial tensions were high on the U.S. Olympic team, where inflamed black athletes had to choose between demands for justice, on the one hand, and loyalty to country, on the other.&nbsp;Although&nbsp;basketball star Lew Alcindor (later to become the great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) decided not to participate, heavyweight boxer George Foreman not only competed and won a gold medal but waved a miniature American flag at foreign judges. Sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos became as famous for their raised-fist gestures of protest as their speed on the track. No one was prepared for Bob Beamon&#x2019;s long jump, which broke the world record by a staggering twenty-two inches. And then there was Dick Fosbury, the goofball high jumper whose backward, upside-down approach to the bar (the &#x201c;Fosbury Flop&#x201d;) baffled his coaches while breaking records.&nbsp;Filled with human drama, <i>Something in the Air</i> is a powerful, unforgettable tale that will resonate with sports fans and readers of social history alike.</p><p>Richard Hoffer was a senior writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> for nineteen years and is the author of <i>A Savage Business: The Comeback and Comedown of Mike Tyson </i>and <i>Jackpot Nation</i>. He lives in Santa Barbara, California, with his wife.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><b>ROADS TO GLORY</b><br><i>Dogs on Ice, a Third-String End, and Robin Hood</i><br><br><p>GEORGE FOREMAN CURLED under the floorboards, the pipes above groaning and dripping, not at all safe, not anywhere near as safe as he'd like. German shepherds barked in the night, a siren sounded at a closing distance. His knowledge of police detection was extremely up???to-date, coming from the cop shows of the day, as well as Fifth Ward intelligence, passed from curbside gangster to gangster. So he knew what he was in for. On hot, humid nights such as this, Houston police traveled with blocks of ice on the backseat, and the dogs were forever refreshed. Moreover, the canines, already heroic sniffers, now came in a genetically upgraded setup and could smell through water. This he had seen on television, maybe on <i>The Fugitive. </i>He couldn't remember. The rain outside, the cracked pavements slick with it, offered Foreman no protection from the maneaters whatsoever, and he quivered in the crawl-space dampness.</p><p>He was small-time, just sixteen, but, up to that point anyway, had tremendous ambition in the hoodlum department. He hardly ever went to school, had no taste for sports, and enjoyed the enforcer's brand of respect. He hoped someday to have a scar on his cheek, and often wore a bandage there until he could acquire his trophy gash. It was 1965, and there was still a juvenile delinquent mystique. Foreman imagined coming back to the neighborhood, having done the inevitable time, say at Huntsville, the kind of guy who "maybe killed a man once." The Fifth Ward would take note of such bona fides as those.</p><p>In the meantime, even at this young age, he was not an unappreciated prospect. The Fifth Ward was a hard neighborhood on Houston's north side -- small frame cottages with diminishing levels of upkeep, and where violence was a kind of recreation. There were about twelve gangs in operation, each representing the special interests of the young men there. There was a dancing gang, for one thing, reenacting <i>Hullabaloo</i> and <i>Shindig!</i> in the alleys, and Foreman's far more intimidating Hester House outfit for another. Aside from being on the lookout for the dancing gang, Foreman's bunch occupied themselves with low-level extortion, and quickly earned a local reputation.</p><p>"First time I met George Foreman, I was in the seventh grade, hanging around the neighborhood store." This is from Lester Hayes, a future NFL star, whose own gang specialized "in doing mischievous things, pillaging the 7-Eleven, things of that nature." Foreman, older by a few years, approached him for the loan of a nickel, and a bite of a hamburger, which he then consumed in its entirety. "The next time I saw George, the idea of a nickel was null and void. I loaned him a quarter. It seemed to me huge inflation was taking place. Of course, I would have gone home and found a quarter for him if I didn't have one on me. He was a very, very big kid and had a reputation for savage butt kickings. That was his forte. So by the early age of twelve, I had met George Foreman twice and I found both occasions extremely taxing."</p><p>Foreman ranged far and wide, at least in the Fifth Ward, extracting his "silver coin toll," as it was known, and administering beatings, often independent of income opportunities. There was no question the money was important, insofar as it could relieve his chronic hunger. He was almost always ravenous, his appetite driven as much by the prospect of scarcity as an actual need for food. His house, absent a male breadwinner, was not one of plenty and, anyway, there was just too much sharing going on. His mother worked at a restaurant for a time and would bring a hamburger home when she could for the six children to share, cut in slivers, and Foreman would nurse his little bite, smell it, kiss it, and glower fiercely at his sisters' remains. But, really, the beatings were the main attraction for him.</p><p>It wasn't very long before Foreman and his gang graduated from squeezing little pups like Hayes to rolling citizens of greater means and, of course, more resistance. This wasn't a matter of right or wrong, which Foreman simply could not recognize, but career advancement. Foreman had despaired of anything grander. Once, caught playing hooky in the sixth grade, a cousin said, forget about it, no big deal. He wasn't going to amount to anything anyway. Foreman protested furiously, announced he would, too, amount to something. In a great show of righteousness, he put on his school clothes. He was so angry he very nearly did go to school. But not that particular day, nor many others like it. No, this was the life for him, except for that barking.</p><p>The Hester House gang, a workaday bunch, generally used the proceeds from their daytime depredations as a kind of capital investment. They bought cheap wine, emboldened themselves even further, then ranged into the night hunting for larger prey. It became a routine, a job even. Foreman, the biggest and most ferocious among them, that bandage doing something for the imagination if his increasing hulk didn't, would level the victim, hold him down while the others -- "the sneaky fellas" -- would rifle the victim's pockets, and they'd all take off with their bounty. They could hear the guy screaming behind them, although it never seemed to produce any effect, and soon they'd slow to a walk and count their money. It never once occurred to Foreman that he had committed a criminal act; he was earning a paycheck.</p><p>But this time, hiding under one of the Fifth Ward's increasingly decrepit cottages, he suspected he had crossed a line. The mugging had been no more or less violent than usual, screams in the night now a workplace hum for him, but the sirens were a surprise. This, evidently, was against the law! More than that, it was just wrong. The barking dogs argued his worthlessness in a way no adult ever had. Each yelp, their nostrils flared with the scent of George Foreman, was an accusation: <i>You're no good.</i></p><p>Foreman was suddenly stung to tears, not so much by the possibility of arrest, which seemed unavoidable now that this new breed of smeller had been unleashed on him, but the sudden recognition that he was embarking on a pointless and, indeed, hurtful life. He prayed then and there, underneath the house, that if ever he got out from under it, he'd never steal again. And if God wasn't sufficient to the task, the dogs being what they were, he covered himself with the dripping sewage from above, slathering it all over himself, a course of confusion, one of last resort for sure, that had been proved somewhat reliable in a cop show of the day.</p><p>In time, the sirens moved on and the barking grew faint in the night, and the young Foreman, smeared with slop, uncurled and got on with his new life.<br></p><p>Just because he was from the right side of town (and in little Medford, Oregon, incredibly, there definitely was a right and a wrong side), Dick Fosbury was no less insulated from adolescent angst than the next teenager. He was tall, gangly to the extreme -- "a grew-too-fast kid," his coach would say -- and not good enough at anything he did to keep him above the hallway fray. Here's how it was at Medford High: Say, Steve Davis (right side of town) spotted Bill Enyart (wrong side), first day of school. He'd grab Enyart by the neck, turn his collar inside out, the source of shame right there on the label, visible for all. "J.C. Penney!" he'd howl. And keep in mind, Enyart was the high school fullback, on his way to becoming Earthquake Enyart, an NFL career down the line. Class distinction offsets brawn, any day. But do you think Davis would recognize Fosbury's shared aristocracy (Fosbury's father was a truck sales manager, his mother a secretary)? If Davis caught Fosbury loitering by his locker, he'd punch him right in the shoulder.</p><p>Medford's bucolic charms -- peach and pear orchards spreading beyond its modest cityscape (population twenty-five thousand, the interstate still a few years off) -- are not a factor during years such as these, not even in these early sixties. A life of privilege, a house on the right side of town, small comfort. Loving parents are great, but not as much use as you'd think when it comes to the ritual humiliation of simply growing up. Did Dick Fosbury have it made? Of course. Was every need fulfilled? Sure. But he was a child of yearning, insufficient achievement, bad skin, his talents such that nobody could possibly take him seriously or dare predict any kind of success for him. He was beginning to understand the curse of the bell curve -- he might very well be average. And when his head hit the pillow, no matter how soft the bed, he was as miserable as the next guy.</p><p>Nothing was really working out, which might be the shared condition of all thirteen-year-olds, but still seems a singular disappointment if it's not working out for you in particular. Fosbury hoped to play basketball. In fact, being 6'4", he fully expected to. But Medford High was loaded and had six guys who could dunk (Steve Davis, a bigger and better athlete, one of them). Fosbury sat on the bench. His senior year, in 1965, he remained at home when the team, top-ranked in the city, went to the state tournament, so that more promising underclassmen could gain the experience. He played football until his junior year, a third-string end (Davis was the primary receiver), when Enyart came up under him during a blocking drill and knocked his two front teeth out. Enyart was his great pal. In the cold of winter, when the coed physical education classes would be given over to dancing inside the gym, the two would stand together on the court's sideline, trying to remain invisible, which was complicated by their tremendous height. Come ladies' choice, though, Big Lois would pick Fosbury, and that would be quite a scene, the two of them doing the Freddy, their long arms and legs flapping out like hinged two-byfours. So Enyart felt bad about those teeth.</p><p>Fosbury's real love was track. It figures that the arts of locomotion are the first to be explored ...</p></p><h2>The Adventures of Antoine Doinel: Autobiographical Screenplays</h2><p>Book by Francois truffaut</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Fodor's Southern California: with Los Angeles, San Diego, the Central Coast &amp; the Best Road Trips (Full-color Travel Guide, 15)</h2><p><b></b><p><b>Written by locals, <i>Fodor&#x2019;s Southern California</i> is the perfect guidebook for those looking for insider tips to make the most out their visit to Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and beyond.

Port and Kit Moresbury, a sophisticated American couple, are finding it more than a little difficult to live with each other. Endeavoring to escape this predicament, they set off for North Africa intending to travel through Algeria - uncertain of exactly where they are heading, but determined to leave the modern world behind. The results of this casually taken decision are both tragic and compelling.</p><p>American novelist and short-story writer, poet, translator, classical music composer, and filmscorer Paul Bowles has lived as an expatriate for more than 40 years in the North African nation of Morocco, a country that reaches into the vast and inhospitable Sahara Desert. The desert is itself a character in <b>The Sheltering Sky</b>, the most famous of Bowles' books, which is about three young Americans of the postwar generation who go on a walkabout into Northern Africa's own arid heart of darkness. In the process, the veneer of their lives is peeled back under the author's psychological inquiry.<p>When <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> was first published in 1949, it established Paul Bowles as one of the most singular and promising writers of the postwar generation. Its startlingly original vision has withstood the test of time and confirmed Tennessee Williams's early estimation: "<em>The Sheltering Sky</em> alone of the books that I have . . . read by American authors appears to bear the spiritual imprint of recent history in the western world." In this classic work of psychological terror, Bowles examines the ways in which Americans apprehend an alien culture and the ways in which their incomprehension destroys them.</p><p>The story of three worldly young travelers Port Moresby, his wife, Kit, and their friend, Tunner--adrift in the cities and deserts of North Africa after World War II, <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> is merciless in its evocation of the emotional dislocation induced by a foreign setting. As the Americans embark on an ill-fated journey through desolate terrain, they are pushed to the limits of human reason and intelligence by the unfathomable emptiness and impassive cruelty of the desert. Along the way, they encounter a host of enigmatic characters whose inarticulate strangeness seals the travelers off even more completely from the culture in which they are traveling, causing their fierce attachments to one another to unravel.</p><p>This special fiftieth anniversary commemorative edition of Bowles's unforgettable first novel includes the original <em>New York Times</em> review by Tennessee Williams and a preface the author wrote for his first novel before he died in 1999.</p></p><h2>Japan: Soul of a Nation</h2><p><b>Featuring over 140 stunning photographs, this Japan travel pictorial captures all the beauty and high culture of Japan.</b><br><br>Japan has fascinated foreign visitors and observers for centuries. Although Columbus did not find fables Zipang and its troves of gold he sought, countless sojourners in Japan ranging from 16th century missionaries to 20th century backpackers with a yen for Zen have had eye opening encounters with this land of contrasts. Physically one of the most beautiful countries in the world, and a civilization in its own right, Japan remains something of an enigma to outsiders. Futuristic visions seem to bloom effortlessly from time-honored traditions.<br><br>This compelling photographic study by one of the world&#x2019;s leading photographers will take you from country roads to the skyscrapers of its amoebae-like megacities, from meditation-inducing rock gardens to the other-worldly frenzy of communal festivals.

According to reports which began to appear in the press in 1991, Bryn Estyn had lain at the centre of a network of evil conspiracy which supposedly involved the extensive homosexual abuse of adolescent boys by a paedophile ring, whose members terrorised their victims and subjected them to a regime of violence and brutality.</p><p></p><h2>Pearson My World Social Studies Texas: We Are Texas (Teacher Edition)</h2><p>Pearson My World Social Studies Texas: We Are Texas (Teacher Edition)</p><p></p><h2>Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat Major: Op. 73 (&#34;Emperor&#34;) (Dover Miniature Music Scores)</h2><p><p>Nicknamed the "Emperor" for its nobility and grandeur, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73, was the composer's last piano concerto. Written in 1809, when Beethoven was 39, it ranks among the most popular concertos in the repertoire. <i>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i> considers it one of the strongest works conceived by Beethoven, and by far the most "symphonic" of his concertos, from the "thunderous cadential celebration" of the very first bars to the brilliant rondo-finale.<br>Reproduced here from an authoritative early edition, the score appears with bar-numbered movements. Ideal for study in the classroom, at home, or in the concert hall, this affordable, high-quality, conveniently sized volume will be the edition of choice for music students and music lovers alike.</p><p></p></p><p>The triumphant genius of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770&#x2013;1827) casts a long shadow over classical music &#x2014; no other composer of the past two centuries has exercised an influence more profound than his. A product of the classicist generation, he was the first of the Romantics, and his exhilarating works remain undiminished in their powers of enchantment.</p><h2>In Great Haste: The Letters of Michael Collins and Kitty Kiernan</h2><p>Even seventy years after his death, Michael Collins remains a colossus of modern Irish history. During the five years before he died, Collins grew particularly close to Kitty Kienan of Grandard in County Longford. Harry Boland also expressed warm affection for Kitty in several letters, but it was the relationship between Michael and Kitty that developed and they planned to marry. They exchanged more than 300 letters which revealed not only their intimacy, but also the extraordinary pressure under which Collins lived during the tempestuous days of 1921 when the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty were being hammered out. A sequence of letters from London in May 1922 shows him near the breaking point. Kitty's letters in turn are full of concern about the life of strain Michael is forced to live and its looming physical danger. Both of them wish for a normal life in marriage.<br><br>This new and splendidly designed edition contains, for the first time, facsimile reproductions of the letters and includes correspondence first discovered in 1994. It is being published to coincide with the release of a major motion picture on Michael Collins, wirtten and directed by Neil Jordan, starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts and based upon the relationship between Michael and Kitty.<br></p><p>Lion O Broin was a distringuished writer, broadcaster, historian and public servent. He died in 1990.<br><br>CIan O Heigeartaigh is a journalist and television producer.<br>Collins (1890-1922) is remembered as the man who outfoxed the British in the Irish War of Independence, led the hard-nosed negotiations that resulted in the eventual establishment of the Irish Republic and became head of state at the age of 31. This book looks at him in a startling new light. We don't see Collins the brutal revolutionary, but rather the man in love as he conducted the affairs of an embryo nation. This volume contains 315 letters between Collins and his fiancee, Kitty Kiernan, a hotel keeper from County Longford. It shows him in a very human state: as one of the most important men in Ireland, he apologizes for not writing because "I had no stamps." We find that Collins attended daily mass during the treaty negotiations in 1921, always lighting a candle for Kiernan; we see him so exhausted that he was always thinking of getting some sleep; and we learn that he allowed Kiernan to call him "Ducky"?probably the most innocuous sobriquet ever bestowed upon him. The late O Broin, a historian, and O hEigeartaigh, a journalist and TV producer, show Collins as a very humble, earnest man, with only the best interests at heart for both Kiernan and the Irish state. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Let the Dead Lie (Emmanuel Cooper)</h2><p>The second in a crime series set in 1950&#39;s South Africa when apartheid laws were first introduced.</p><p>Malla Nunn was born in Swaziland, South Africa, and currently lives in Sydney, Australia. She is a filmmaker with three award-winning films to her credit and is currently at work on her next novel.<b><b>1</b></b><br> <br><b>DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA, MAY 28, 1953</b><br> <br><b>THE ENTRANCE TO</b> the freight yards was a dark mouth crowded with rows of dirty boxcars and threads of silver track. A few white prostitutes orbited a weak streetlight. Indian and coloured working girls were tucked into the shadows, away from the passing trade and the police.<br> <br>Emmanuel Cooper crossed Point Road and moved toward the yards. The prostitutes stared at him, and the boldest of them, a fat redhead with a molting fox fur slung around her shoulders, lifted a skirt to expose a thigh encased in black fishnet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sweetheart,&#x201d; she bellowed. &#x201c;Are you buying or just window-shopping?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emmanuel slipped into the industrial maze. Did he look that desperate? Brine and coal dust blew off Durban Harbor and the lights of a docked cruise ship shone across the water. Stationary gantry cranes loomed over the avenue of boxcars and a bright half-moon lit the rocky ground. He moved to the center of the yards, tracing a now familiar path. He was tired, and not from the late hour. Trawling the docks after midnight was worse than being a foot policeman. They at least had a clearly defined mission: to enforce the law. His job was to witness a mind-numbing parade of petty violence, prostitution and thievery and do nothing.<br> <br>He scrambled over a heavy coupling and settled into a space between two wagons. Soon, an ant trail of trucks would roll out of the yard, packed to the limit with whiskey and cut tobacco and boxes of eau de cologne. English, Afrikaner, foot police, detectives and railway police: the smuggling operation was a perfect example of how different branches of the force were able to cooperate and coordinate if they shared a common goal.<br> <br>He flicked the surveillance notebook open. Four columns filled the faintly ruled paper: names, times, license plate numbers and descriptions of stolen goods. Until these cold nights in the freight yard he&#x2019;d thought the wait for the Normandy landing was the pinnacle of boredom. The restlessness and the fear of the massed army, the bland food and the stink of the latrines: he&#x2019;d weathered it all without complaint. The discomforts weren&#x2019;t so different from what he&#x2019;d experienced in the tin and concrete slum shacks his family had lived in on the outskirts of Jo&#x2019;burg.<br> <br>This surveillance of corrupt policemen lacked the moral certainty of D-day. What Major van Niekerk, his old boss from the Marshall Square Detective Branch, planned to do with the information in the notebook was unclear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus. Oh, Jesus ...&#x201d; A groaned exhalation floated across the freight yards, faint on the breeze. Some of the cheaper sugar girls made use of the deserted boxcars come nightfall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh ... no ...&#x201d; This time the male voice was loud and panicked.<br> <br>The skin on Emmanuel&#x2019;s neck prickled. The urge to investigate reared up, but he resisted. His job was to watch and record the activities of the smuggling ring, not rescue a drunken whaler lost in the freight yard. Do <i>not</i> get involved. Major van Niekerk had been very specific about that.<br> <br>The faint hum of traffic along Point Road mingled with a wordless sobbing. Instinct pulled Emmanuel to the sound. He hesitated and then shoved the notepad into a pants pocket. Ten minutes to take a look and then he&#x2019;d be back to record the truck license plate numbers. Twenty minutes at the outside. He pulled a silver torch from a pocket, switched it on and ran toward the warehouses built along the northeast boundary of the freight terminus.<br> <br>The sobs faded and then became muffled. Possibly the result of a hand held over a mouth. Emmanuel stopped and tried to isolate the sound. The yards were huge, with miles of track running the length of the working harbor. Loose gravel moved underfoot and a cry came from ahead. Emmanuel turned the torch to high beam and picked up the pace. The world appeared in flashes. Ghostly rows of stationary freight cars, chains, redbrick walls covered in grime and a back lane littered with empty hessian sacks. Then a dark river of blood that formed a question mark in the dirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;No ...&#x201d;<br> <br>Emmanuel swung the torch beam in the direction of the voice and caught two Indian men in the full glare of the light. Both were young, with dark, slicked-back hair that touched their shoulders. They wore white silk shirts and nearly identical suits made from silvery sharkskin material. One, a slim teenager with a tear-streaked face, was slumped against the back wall of the warehouse. The other, somewhere in his early twenties, sported an Errol Flynn mustache and a heavy brow contracted with menace. He hunched over the boy, with his hand over his mouth to keep him quiet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do not move.&#x201d; Emmanuel used his detective sergeant&#x2019;s voice. He reached for his .38 standard Webley revolver and touched an empty space&#x2013;like a war veteran fumbling for a phantom limb. The most dangerous weapon he had was a pen. No matter. The gun was backup.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run!&#x201d; the older one screamed. &#x201c;Go!&#x201d;<br> <br>The men ran in different directions and Emmanuel targeted the smaller of the two, who stumbled and pitched toward the ground. Emmanuel caught a sleeve and steadied the teenager against the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run again and I&#x2019;ll break your arm,&#x201d; he said. A coupling clanked. The older one was still out there somewhere. Emmanuel rested shoulder to shoulder with the boy and waited.<br> <br>&#x201c;Parthiv.&#x201d; The boy sniffled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Amal,&#x201d; a voice called back. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here. He got me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got Amal,&#x201d; Emmanuel said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better come out and keep him company.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man emerged from the dark with a gangster swagger. A gold necklace complemented his silvery suit, and a filigree ring topped with a chunk of purple topaz weighed down his index finger.<br> <br>&#x201c;And just who the hell are you?&#x201d; the skollie demanded.<br> <br>Emmanuel relaxed. He&#x2019;d put down thugs like this one on a daily basis back in Jo&#x2019;burg. Back before the trouble in Jacob&#x2019;s Rest.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Detective Sergeant Emmanuel Cooper,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>With the National Party now in control, the police had become the most powerful gang in South Africa. The air went out of the Indian&#x2019;s hard-man act.<br> <br>&#x201c;Names,&#x201d; Emmanuel said when the men were against the wall. He&#x2019;d deal with the fact that he had no authority and no jurisdiction later.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,&#x201d; the Indian Errol Flynn said. He looked tough and he talked tough but something about the flashy suit and the jewelry made him look a little ... soft.<br> <br>&#x201c;Names,&#x201d; Emmanuel repeated.<br> <br>&#x201c;Amal,&#x201d; the youngster said quickly. &#x201c;My name is Amal Dutta and that&#x2019;s my brother, Parthiv Dutta.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stay put,&#x201d; Emmanuel instructed, and dipped the torchlight toward the ground. A bottle of lemonade lay on its side near the pool of blood. Then, in the shadows, Emmanuel made out the curled fingers of a child&#x2019;s hand. They seemed almost to motion him closer. A white boy lay in the dirt, arms outstretched, skinny legs tangled together. His throat was sliced open from ear to ear like a second mouth.<br> <br>Emmanuel recognized the victim: an English slum kid, around eleven years old, who picked a living among the boxcars and the whores. Jolly Marks. Who knew if that was his real name?<br> <br>Starting at the tattered canvas shoes, Emmanuel searched upward over the body. Army-issue fatigues were rolled up at the cuffs and threadbare at the knees. A line of string was tied to the belt loop of the khaki pants and a smear of blood stained the waistband. Streaks of dirt fanned out across the boy&#x2019;s gray shirt and gathered in the creases around his mouth. The search revealed the lack of something in every detail. The lack of money evident in Jolly&#x2019;s shabby clothes. The lack of hygiene in the tangled hair and filthy nails. The lack of a parent who might stop a young boy from going out onto the Durban docks after dark.<br> <br>Emmanuel focused the light on the stained waistband again. Jolly Marks always had a small notebook attached to the belt loop of the khaki pants, where he wrote orders for smokes and food. The string that held the book was still there, but the book itself was missing. That fact might be significant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did either of you pick up a spiral notebook with a string attached?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the brothers answered simultaneously.<br> <br>Emmanuel crouched next to the body. An inch from Jolly&#x2019;s right hand was a rusty penknife with the small blade extended. Emmanuel had owned a similar knife at almost exactly the same age. Jolly had understood that bad things happened out here at night.<br> <br>Emmanuel knew this boy, knew the details of his life without having to ask a single question. He&#x2019;d grown up with boys like Jolly Marks. No, that was a lie. This was whom he&#x2019;d grown up <i>as</i>. A dirty white boy. This could have been his fate: first on the streets of a Jo&#x2019;burg slum and then on the battlefields in Europe. He had escaped and survived. Jolly would never have that chance. Emmanuel returned to the Indian men.<br> <br>&#x201c;Either one of you touch this boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d; Amal&#x2019;s body shook with the denial. &#x201c;Never, never ever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You?&#x201d; Emmanuel asked Parthiv.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. No ways. We were minding our own business and there he was.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nobody in the back lanes of the Durban port after midnight was minding his own business unless that business was illegal. There was, however, a big difference between stealing and murder, and the brothers&#x2019; sharkskin suits were pressed and clean. Emmanuel checked their hands, also clean. Jolly lay in a bloodbath, his neck cut with a single stroke: the work of an experienced butcher.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have either of you seen the boy before, maybe talked to him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Parthiv said, too quickly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d never seen him.&#x201d; Amal&#x2019;s voice broke on the words. &#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d stayed at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emmanuel tilted the torch beam away from the teenager&#x2019;s face. Violent death was shocking, but the violent death of a child was different; the effects sank deeper and lingered longer. Amal was only a few years older than Jolly and probably still a schoolboy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit down and rest against the wall,&#x201d; Emmanuel said.<br> <br>Amal sank to the ground and sucked breath in through an open mouth. A panic attack was in the cards. &#x201c;Are you going to ... to ... arrest us, Detective?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emmanuel pulled a small flask from a jacket pocket and unscrewed the lid. He handed it to Amal, who pulled back.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t drink. My mother says it makes you stupid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Make an exception for tonight,&#x201d; Emmanuel said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mostly coffee anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>The teenager took a slurp and coughed till fat tears spilled from his eyes. Parthiv gave a derisive snort, embarrassed by his younger brother&#x2019;s inability to hold liquor. Emmanuel pocketed the flask and checked the narrow alley between the warehouse wall and the goods train.<br> <br>He had a body in the open, no murder weapon and two witnesses who, in all probability, had stumbled onto the crime scene. This was a detective&#x2019;s nightmare&#x2013;but also a detective&#x2019;s dream. The scene was all his. There were no foot police to trample evidence into the mud and no senior detectives jockeying for control of the investigation. Clumps of vegetation embedded in the gravel shuddered in a sudden breeze. Beyond Jolly&#x2019;s body, the butt of a hand-rolled cigarette blew on the ground. Emmanuel picked it up and smelled it&#x2013;vanilla and chocolate. It was a special blend of flavored tobacco.<br> <br>&#x201c;You smoke, Parthiv?&#x201d; Emmanuel asked over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What brand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Old Gold. They&#x2019;re American.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know them,&#x201d; Emmanuel said. Half the Yank army had puffed their way across Europe on Old Gold and Camel. For a few years it seemed that the smell of freedom was American tobacco and corned beef. Old Gold was a mass-market cigarette imported into South Africa. The vanilla and chocolate tobacco was probably made to order.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about you, Amal ... do you smoke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not even a puff after school?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only once. I didn&#x2019;t like it. It hurt my lungs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parthiv snorted again.<br> <br>Emmanuel shone the beam on Jolly&#x2019;s hands and face. Amal looked away. There were no defense wounds on the boy&#x2019;s hands despite the open penknife. The killer had worked fast and with maximum efficiency. Maybe it was the night chill that made the murder read cold and dispassionate. The word <i>professional</i> came to Emmanuel&#x2019;s mind.<br> <br>This was hardly a description that fit either one of the Dutta boys. He played the torchlight over the rough ground again, looking for hard evidence. Jolly&#x2019;s order book was nowhere near the body.<br> <br>A coupling creaked in the darkness. Parthiv and Amal focused on an object in the gloom of the freight yard behind him. Emmanuel swiveled and a black hole opened up and swallowed him.<br> <br>� 2010 Malla Nunn</p><h2>Trifle (English Kitchen)</h2><p>Relaxing after the labours of the&nbsp;Oxford Companion to Food, the late Alan Davidson and his trusty lieutenant of the last years of its compilation, Helen Saberi, turned their spotlight on trifle. Nothing is more emblematic of English cookery. Trifles have been a perennial of English summer lunches, tennis parties, and schoolboy dreams of plenty. The authors trace their origins to the earliest recipe of 1596 and its gradual transformation from a mere cooked cream to the many-layered custardy extravagance we know today. The stages on its journey, described with the lightest of touch, are illustrated by recipes extracted from classic English cookery books. With their customary brilliance they have universalised the English experience, casting far and wide for examples, returning home with trifles from Laos, America, Australasia, Mexico, Eritrea, South Africa, Afghanistan, Malta, and even Norway, where Veiled Maidens are all the rage at teatime. The resulting recipes, handy tips and historical speculation amount to a ladleful of wit and amusement.</p><p>The late Alan Davidson was one of Britain&#x2019;s most distinguished writers on food.

Fadigati is hopeful and modern, and more than anything wants to fit into his new home. But his fresh, appealing appearance soon crumbles when the townsfolk discover his homosexuality, and the young man he pays to be his lover humiliates him publicly. As anti-Semitism spreads across Italy, the Jewish narrator of the tale begins to feel pity for the ostracized doctor, as the fickle nature of a community changing under political forces becomes clear. The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles is a gripping and tragic study of how lives can be destroyed by those we consider our neighbours.</p><p>Giorgio Bassani was born in 1916. From 1938 onwards he became involved in various anti-fascist activities for which he was imprisoned in 1943.

It is the perfect complement to Graham Greene`s much-loved, much-admired Ways of Escape.</p></p><p><br> <b>GRAHAM GREENE</b> wrote over 50 books, including such modern classics as <i>Our Man in Havana</i>, <i>The Quiet American</i>, <i>The End of the Affair</i>, <i>The Heart of the Matter</i>, <i>The End of the Affair</i> and <i>The Power and the Glory</i>. Born in Birkhamsted, England, he lived in Paris and Antibes before his death in April 1991.Like the recent Last Stories , this is a collection of previously uncollected material--in this case essays, reviews and travel pieces from the entire length of the author's 60-year writing career (the earliest written while he was still at Oxford). The material varies considerably in interest and quality, though it is surprising to observe that from the start the eye for the telling, often sordid detail was at work, the knack for establishing atmosphere in a deft stroke or two. The travel pieces are superbly crafted essays, combining politics and sociology seamlessly with history and scenery: on Indo-China before the Vietnam War, on old and new Cuba, on Haiti, Paraguay, a haunting evocation of Goa. Greene also wrote passionately and despairingly on the possibilities--and mostly failed promise--of film; a movie critic in the '30s, he was one of the best. A collection like this does not add to his reputation but is interesting, nonetheless, for the consistency of his dour vision. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Discovering the Depths</h2><p>Sorry, we have no information on this book.</p><p></p><h2>Going Up!: Elisha Otis&#39;s Trip to the Top (Great Idea Series)</h2><p>This is the fourth book in Tundra's <i>Great Idea Serie</i>s of biographies for young readers.

Known for introducing biography to children who are just learning to read, she has written about Harriet Tubman, Houdini, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Amelia Earhart, among others. Her book <b>It's a Snap!

He began his career at Dyfed College of Art in Wales, where he studied wildlife illustration. From there, he attended the Lincoln College of Art.</p>Kulling gives lesser-known inventor Elisha Otis a lift in this latest entry into the Great Idea series. As a boy in the early 1800s, Otis enjoyed watching the pulleys and ropes hoist&#x2014;and occasionally drop&#x2014;hay on his family&#x2019;s farm. After his grist mill, which he built himself, went bust, he found success creating a rail-turner machine for a bed-frame factory and inventing a hoisting platform for heavy machinery. Unlike the pulleys and ropes of his boyhood, this platform had a safety break to avoid crashes. But when Otis expanded his operation to make elevators that would hoist people, spectators were skeptical. A daring demonstration in the Crystal Palace of the 1854 World&#x2019;s Fair in New York convinced the audience of the viability of elevators and paved the way for skyscrapers. Although it wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible for Otis&#x2019; wife to &#x201c;almost see the lightbulb over her husband&#x2019;s head&#x201d; in 1845, this picture-book biography gives a lively account of Otis&#x2019; world-changing invention.

A striking feature of the book is the way in which every word of God is contradicted or questioned by his people. God&#39;s persistence in speaking to them is a clear picture of sin and grace in close proximity. Furthermore, God&#39;s people neither served him enthusiastically nor turned away in blatant disobedience. This was not neutral territory, but a dangerous whirlpool of self-deception. Peter Adam&#39;s valuable exposition shows how Malachi is God&#39;s effective remedy for such a situation. The greatest sin of God&#39;s people is the sin against God - the source of all sin against ourselves and others; and at the heart of God&#39;s people, the church, must lie a deep, overwhelming conviction that God loves them.</p><p>Adam, formerly principal of Ridley College in Melbourne, Australia, is emeritus vicar of St. Jude's in nearby Carlton. His other books include <em>Speaking God's Words: A Practical Theology of Preaching.</em>"These ancient themes still challenge us today, and Adam continually points us toward the saving work of Christ while reminding us of them. <em>The Message of Malachi</em> will prove a valuable resource for those who desire to preach from Malachi or simply understand it better."

His compelling narrative follows the driving ambition of General Hideki Tojo, the Army strongman who rose to Minister of War and then to Japanese Premier, and Isoroku Yamamoto, mastermind of the attack on Pearl Harbor. After the Japanese suffered their defeat at Midway in 1942, they no longer ruled the Pacific. By 1944, they knew any possibility of victory was remote. From their daring plans to regain control of the sea to the nightmare that followed the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this fascinating chronicle captures all the tension of a nation at war.<br></p><p>William Craig (1929&#x2013;1997) was an American historian and novelist. Born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, he interrupted his career as an advertising salesman to appear&nbsp;on the quiz show <i>Tic-Tac-Dough</i> in 1958.&nbsp;With his $42,000 in winnings&#x2014;a record-breaking amount at the time&#x2014;Craig enrolled at Columbia University and earned both an undergraduate and a master&#x2019;s degree in history. He published his first book, <i>The Fall of Japan</i>, in 1967. A narrative history of the final weeks of&nbsp;World War II&nbsp;in the Pacific, it reached the top ten on the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller list and was deemed &#x201c;virtually flawless&#x201d; by&nbsp;the<i> New York Times Book Review</i>. In order to write&nbsp;<i>Enemy at the Gates&nbsp;</i>(1973), a documentary account of the Battle of Stalingrad, Craig travelled to three continents and interviewed hundreds of military and civilian survivors. A&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller, the book inspired a film of the same name starring Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes.

I was in third grade. So what if Richard Lederer has come up with a chemical compound that consists of 1,913 letters? Owning a word like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is empowering at any age. If you have ever been completely wowed by the power you can have over language, or its power over you, Richard Lederer is your patron saint. His oft-reprinted introduction to <i>Crazy English</i>, which was originally published in 1989, claims that English is "the most loopy and wiggy of all tongues." And then he demonstrates: "In what other language do people drive in a parkway and park in a driveway? ... Why do they call them <i>apartments</i> when they're all together?" And so on. Lederer's pace is frenetic. He alights on oxymorons ("pretty ugly," "computer jock"), redundancies, confusing words (are you sure you know the meaning of <i>enormity</i>?), phobias, contronyms, heteronyms, retroactive terms (<i>acoustic guitar</i>, <i>rotary phone</i>), and a host of other linguistic delights.<p> Though English may be one of the crazier languages--Lederer claims that about 80 percent of our words are not spelled phonetically--they are all, he says, a little crazy. "That's because language is invented ... by boys and girls and men and women, not computers. As such, language reflects the creative and fearful asymmetry of the human race, which, of course, isn't really a race at all." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Richard Lederer is the author of more than 30 books about language, history, and humor, including his best-selling <i>Anguished English</i> series and his current book, <i>Presidential Trivia</i>. He has been profiled in magazines as diverse as <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>People</i>, and the <i>National Enquirer</i> and frequently appears on radio as a commentator on language. Dr. Lederer's syndicated column, "Looking at Language," appears in newspapers and magazines throughout the United States. He has been named International Punster of the Year and Toastmasters International's Golden Gavel winner.</p><h2>The Blob that Ate Everyone (Goosebumps #55)</h2><p>They're baa-ack!

Little ones will bounce with anticipation as the simple yet clever text takes them to visit one sheep and then another. The green sheep, however, is nowhere to be seen until the final spread, where he is found under a very green bush, fast asleep. Until the lost sheep turns up, children will have fun with the other sheep that make an appearance and perhaps, unbeknownst to them, also get lessons in colors and comparisons (the <i>near</i> sheep, the <i>far</i> sheep). In this neat and satisfying wedding of text and art, the squat, square format uses wool-white backgrounds to display much of the amusing pen-and-watercolor pictures. As for the sheep themselves, Horacek has concocted simply lined happy animals, whose wool is indicated by dozens of curlicues. Laughs and interactive play will ensue among readers and listeners, alone or in groups. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Paris - the city and its people - has pervaded his work ever since he first exchanged his paintbrushes for a camera, influenced by the Surrealist movement of the late 1920s. A propos de Paris presents the photographer's personal selection of more than 130 of his best photographs of Paris, taken over fifty years. As ever, his vision transforms photojournalism into high art, revealing images of Paris with a rare, dreamlike, almost crystalline clarity. He unfolds before our eyes a kind of intellectual reconstruction of the city, reaching far beyond the cliches of tourism and popular myth.
